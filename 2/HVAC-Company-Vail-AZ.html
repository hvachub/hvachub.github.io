<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized.
