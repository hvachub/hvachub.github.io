<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly described as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>We recommend utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as a very effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
