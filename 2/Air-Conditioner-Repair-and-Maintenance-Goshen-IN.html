<p>The predominant health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
