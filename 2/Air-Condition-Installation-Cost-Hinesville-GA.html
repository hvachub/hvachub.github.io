<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
