<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
