So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things first. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
