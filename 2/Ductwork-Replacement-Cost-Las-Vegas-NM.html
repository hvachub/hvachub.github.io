These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been damp for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in hidden or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
