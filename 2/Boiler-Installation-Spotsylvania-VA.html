<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
