<h3>Heating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Repairing Wants in Niles MI</h3>

<p>Since an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil, both should be kept clean.

Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
