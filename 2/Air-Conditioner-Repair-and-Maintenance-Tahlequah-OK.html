All five other companies estimated me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who explained to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he advised me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the issue.

Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you buy a replacement-- which you ought to do quickly.<p>
