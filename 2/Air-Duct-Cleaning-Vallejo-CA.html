<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic modus operandi for contemporary a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the ac system increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
