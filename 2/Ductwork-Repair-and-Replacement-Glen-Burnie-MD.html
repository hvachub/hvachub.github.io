<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't need.<p>
