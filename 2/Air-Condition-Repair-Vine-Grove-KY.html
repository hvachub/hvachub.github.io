<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
