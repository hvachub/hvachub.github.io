<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system rather of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In fact, many office buildings have considerable air pollution sources A few of these buildings might be inadequately aerated. For example, mechanical ventilation systems may not be created or run to supply appropriate amounts of outdoor air.
