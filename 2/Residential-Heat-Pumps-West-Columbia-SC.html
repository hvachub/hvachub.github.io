<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the correct temperature level. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
