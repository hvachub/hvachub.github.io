Permeable materials, floor, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold development and should be disposed of. Sometimes there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in covert or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area using established health department suggestions.<p>
