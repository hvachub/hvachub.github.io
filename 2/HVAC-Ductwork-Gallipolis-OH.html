<p>. Before picking the installation area of ac system, several primary elements need to be thought about. First off, the instructions of air circulation from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Secondly, there should not be any barriers on the way of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the area of the facilities as much as possible. The outside unit needs to also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from your house will not be effectively released outdoors and the productivity of the whole system will drop dramatically. It is highly a good idea to set up the a/c units in easily accessible places, for more maintenance during operation.<p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
