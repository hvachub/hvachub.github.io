<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Merrimack NH</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the air conditioning. I went ahead and purchased this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done rather well. It takes very little time to heat up or cool down your house which is among the important things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like extended automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the needed skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been operating issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
