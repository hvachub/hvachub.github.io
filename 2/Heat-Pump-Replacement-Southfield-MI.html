<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Current studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up processes.

If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have actually been properly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
