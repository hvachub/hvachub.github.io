<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
