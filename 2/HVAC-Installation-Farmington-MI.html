<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature throughout the year.
