<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. Another element of the job is encouraging clients regarding how to avoid future problems and properly preserve equipment by, for instance, regularly oiling parts or changing filters.
