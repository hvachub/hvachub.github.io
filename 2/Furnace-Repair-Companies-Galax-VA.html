<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant reactions to indoor air toxins depends on a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual reacts to a toxin depends upon private level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to person. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to chemical or biological toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be serious. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, kids, and babies are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more conscious the destructive results of lead. Kids may have greater exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>

<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to begin without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can almost always conclude that the capacitor has actually failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the opportunities are good that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
<p>Some health results can be beneficial indicators of an indoor air quality problem, specifically if they appear after a person moves to a brand-new house, remodels or refurnishes a home, or deals with a home with pesticides. If you think that you have symptoms that might be associated with your house environment, discuss them with your physician or your local health department to see if they could be caused by indoor air contamination. You might also wish to consult a board-certified specialist or an occupational medication expert for responses to your concerns.<p>
