They came out quickly and offered me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't simply their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
