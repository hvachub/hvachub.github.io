<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
