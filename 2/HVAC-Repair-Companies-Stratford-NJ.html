<p>Seattle heaters can run nine months of the year. Based on the typical temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life-span of 15 years. Your heater will work hard for you, but like your cars and truck, doing routine and regular maintenance will keep it running efficiently, prevent issues, and keep your service warranty intact.<p>
<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioner, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioner? If your house is not equipped with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too large and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too little and your a/c unit won't have the ability to cool the house correctly. When shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the aspects that you require to take into account. Each option can and will considerably impact your system's performance, which is why you can't afford to neglect any of them.<p>
<p>With the cost of electrical energy and gas increasing, it is very important to have your furnace tuned-up for optimum energy savings. This will keep you from unnecessarily paying more than you should. Paragon Heating & Home Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Examination of your furnace includes a Performance Check-Up, in which the thermostat is checked for precision and the burners are changed for maximum efficiency. Apotheosis Heating & Home Comfort Solutions DOES NOT use the ineffective 'eyeball the flame' technique that other companies use. Rather, the combustion is enhanced by measuring the exhaust gasses and making clinical modifications. This alone might spend for the entire maintenance go to at today's cost of gas.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without being available in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
