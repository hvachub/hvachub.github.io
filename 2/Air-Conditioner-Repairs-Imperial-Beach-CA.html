<p>Some air conditioning systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy.

The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air.

Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
