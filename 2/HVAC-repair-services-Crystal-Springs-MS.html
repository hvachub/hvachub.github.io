<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I highly advise using this service. Very trustworthy incredibly nice. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty fast and effective and did not have to pay an arm and a leg to get it done.
