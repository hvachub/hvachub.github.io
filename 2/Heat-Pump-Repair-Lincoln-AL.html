<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all need some fundamental maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping airborne toxins streaming through your system. They can likewise keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
