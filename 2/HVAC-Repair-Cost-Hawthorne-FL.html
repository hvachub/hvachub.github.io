<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are rated for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s might be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
