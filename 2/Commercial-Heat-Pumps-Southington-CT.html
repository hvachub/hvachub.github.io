<p>A specific ac system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are positioned in the exact same air path. A basic air conditioning unit transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil launches heat outside. Nevertheless, considering that all components of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same quantity of power.<p>
