<p>Professional heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually fail. HVAC professionals advise following this standard rule when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
