<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
