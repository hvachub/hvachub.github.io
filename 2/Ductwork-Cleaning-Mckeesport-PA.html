<p>I'll start with a gas furnace because it's the most common heating unit in Seattle homes. Warm air is provided to the spaces of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are ranked for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%.

<p>Many individuals underestimate the extent of the indoor air pollution problem. Air pollution is generally imagined as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints used in the home.

<p>Numerous HVAC business owners do not realize they require various rates plans for various services that their company offers. For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced in a different way from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service need to be priced differently from duct cleaning. If you are offering more than one service, you must separate these into various departments, as if they were their own different company.<p>

Throughout high usage months, check the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
