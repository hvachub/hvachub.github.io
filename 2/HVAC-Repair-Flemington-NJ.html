<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Flemington New Jersey</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>Airflow patterns in structure are figured out by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural effects. Air pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne contaminants from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure through any available opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure amounts to the exterior.<p>
