<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-kept heating equipment can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills suddenly seem higher than regular, it is most likely time to consider a new system. New heating devices is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel bills right away, not to mention the money you'll minimize repair costs. If your heater is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel costs in half.<p>
<p>The first ac system and fridges employed flammable or poisonous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
