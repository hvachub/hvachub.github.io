<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>

They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will eventually stop carrying out as you anticipate it to if they're not cleaned up and replaced regularly.

<p>The predominant health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
