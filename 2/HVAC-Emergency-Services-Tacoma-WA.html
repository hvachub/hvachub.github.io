<p>The quality of the air inside our houses, offices and schools matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is extra-large, it may not attain a low humidity.

A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>Place the solar storage tank near the conventional hot water heater.

Set up unions at the tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not need to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed.<p>

<p>A customized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, however varies from a basic air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the exact same air path.
