Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
