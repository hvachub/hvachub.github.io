<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems.

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
