<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Middletown DE</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of replacing or exchanging air in any area to supply high indoor air quality which involves temperature control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, smells, smoke, heat, dust, airborne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of unpleasant smells and extreme moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air circulating, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
