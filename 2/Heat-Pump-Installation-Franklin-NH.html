<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources may not present a significant health danger by themselves, the majority of homes have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe threat from the cumulative results of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that many people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to prevent new issues from happening.

<p>Equipment expenses are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however lead to greater energy costs.

Electric furnaces begin at $395 and range as much as $1,700 or more depending upon the brand and furnace size.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions.
