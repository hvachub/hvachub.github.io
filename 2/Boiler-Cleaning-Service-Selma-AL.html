<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he spent educating me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a simple repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He was friendly, simple and a completely satisfying person to have around that whole time. His time and know-how to FIX the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years approximately. Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Photo 6).<p>

Follow the producer's instructions, particularly instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heating unit effectively adjusted.
