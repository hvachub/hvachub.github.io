<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer vehicle debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
