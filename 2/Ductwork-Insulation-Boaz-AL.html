Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
