<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned making use of ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>

<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years back and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>

They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was six months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
