This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
