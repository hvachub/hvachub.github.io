<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
