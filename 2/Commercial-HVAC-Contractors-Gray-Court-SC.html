<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled.
