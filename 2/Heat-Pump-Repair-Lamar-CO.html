<p>Specialist heating system installations. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these firms supply opportunities they can't attain on their own. Most owners stick with the bigger firms after acquisition. In many cases, the acquisition offers a way for the seller to retire and make certain employees are looked after. For the most part, the acquiring companies want the owner to remain. Reedy prefers the owners remain on and reinvest a part of their equity from the sale back into the company, although this isn't a requirement.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow paths, ventilation system elements, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
