<p>UW trainees, visitors and staff members ought to have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform different activities. , if the air quality is bad it can impact an individual's health, comfort, and productivityEfficiencyPerformance The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to offer and maintain comfortable and healthy environments free of contaminants. A key part of the program is responding to and dealing with issues of building occupants about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may observe undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems.
