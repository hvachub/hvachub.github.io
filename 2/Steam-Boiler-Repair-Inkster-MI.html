<h3>Common Gas Furnace Parts and Problems in Inkster MI</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is because something is unclean or blocked Before trying to repair any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". If the air filter is excellent to go, examine the furnace blower for clogging and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it. If you still can not determine why your furnace keeps running, call a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept tidy. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
