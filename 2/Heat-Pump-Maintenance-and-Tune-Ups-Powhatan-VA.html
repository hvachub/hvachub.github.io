<p>Specific instant effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to identify if the signs are an outcome of exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to pay attention to the time and location the signs take place.

Some effects may be made worse by an insufficient supply of outdoor air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
