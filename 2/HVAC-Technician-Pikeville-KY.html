<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning.
