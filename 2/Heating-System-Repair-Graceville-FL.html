<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as an Important Company in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient.

Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or higher capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>If no impurity sources are found, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air causes "stagnant air" conditions.

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was really clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12.
