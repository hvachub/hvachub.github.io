<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
<h3>HVAC Repair in Los Altos California</h3>
<p>Many individuals ignore the level of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is normally envisioned as the black smoke given off from factories. Little idea is provided to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, pesticides, and cleaners used in the home. To intensify the problem, it is approximated that the average American spends 70 percent to 90 percent of his/her time inside your home, and more than half that time is invested in the house.<p>
<p>Numerous HVAC business owners do not understand they need various rates schemes for various services that their company uses. For example, residential HVAC installation must be priced differently from commercial HVAC installation, and an HVAC service should be priced differently from duct cleaning. If you are using more than one service, you should separate these into various departments, as if they were their own separate organisation.<p>
