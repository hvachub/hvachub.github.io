<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become air-borne. Infected central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then disperse these pollutants through the house.<p>
