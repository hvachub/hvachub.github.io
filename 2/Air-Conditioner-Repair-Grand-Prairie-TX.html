<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
