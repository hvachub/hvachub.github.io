While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems operate separately from each other.<p>
