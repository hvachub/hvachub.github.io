"Humidifier fever" is a common disease brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungi and germs grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be dispersed into the air and inhaled by the building residents. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>

<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't emit heat efficiently and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
