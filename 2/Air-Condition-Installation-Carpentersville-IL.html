<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically linked to terminal systems like baseboard heating systems. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout the house.
