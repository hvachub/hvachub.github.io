<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire.

One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a great opportunity; you might have a water leakage in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that connects to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on uncommon events.<p>
