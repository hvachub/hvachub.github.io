Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the roadway. So, make sure to alter your AC filters regularly, or get an air conditioning service plan which normally consists of a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
