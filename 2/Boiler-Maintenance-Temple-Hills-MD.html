<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
