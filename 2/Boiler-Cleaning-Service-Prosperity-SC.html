Also, some specific illness have been connected to specific air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate symptoms but can result in cancer after many years.<p>
<p>The ability of organic chemicals to cause health impacts differs greatly, from those that are extremely toxic, to those with no known health result. Just like other contaminants, the degree and nature of the health impact will depend upon lots of aspects including level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and breathing tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual conditions, and memory impairment are among the immediate signs that some individuals have experienced soon after direct exposure to some organics. At present, very little is learnt about what health effects occur from the levels of organics generally discovered in houses. Numerous organic substances are known to cause cancer in animals; some are thought of triggering, or are known to cause, cancer in humans.<p>
