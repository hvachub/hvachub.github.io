<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have problems, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
