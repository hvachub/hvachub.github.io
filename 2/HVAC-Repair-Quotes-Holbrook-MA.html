Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and the people." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle house owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>When every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you ought to get your HVAC system visually inspected at least. This inspection is a crucial aspect of HVAC maintenance.
