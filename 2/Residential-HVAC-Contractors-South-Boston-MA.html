According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues.

Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. An unclean filter likewise triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
