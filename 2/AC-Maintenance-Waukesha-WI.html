<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
