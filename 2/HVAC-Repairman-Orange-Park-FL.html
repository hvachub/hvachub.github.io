<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your vehicle. A dirty filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of regular monthly.<p>

Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
