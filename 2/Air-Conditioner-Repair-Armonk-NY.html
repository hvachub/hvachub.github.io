<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his employees, devices costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not seem like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the very same in all other locations.<p>
