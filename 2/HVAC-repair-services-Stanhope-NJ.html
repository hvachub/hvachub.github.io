No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, appropriate air circulation (ventilation), appropriate filtration, and humidity manage all add to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, frequent maintenance of the HVAC system will guarantee that it is running safely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both need to be kept tidy. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually result in damage to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
