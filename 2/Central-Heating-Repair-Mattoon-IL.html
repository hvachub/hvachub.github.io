<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the a/c separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
