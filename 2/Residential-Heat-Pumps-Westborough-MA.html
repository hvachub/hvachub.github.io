<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Company in Westborough</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the exact same indoor air issues as single-family houses because much of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure materials, furnishings, and home products, are comparable.

<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Westborough Massachusetts</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
