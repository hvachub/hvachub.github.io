<p>The term radiant heating covers a couple of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating components set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heating units. When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
