<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment producer's to guarantee your factory warranties stay in place. Moreover, the concrete results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one action stated the savings in effectiveness or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated usage of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. , if that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.. a really useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
