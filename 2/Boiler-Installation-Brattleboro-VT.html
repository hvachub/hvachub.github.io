As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-sealed and well-insulated, but we do not believe enough about direct exposure to all the things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and buildings has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right now, they can come on years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Here's how to breathe simpler.<p>
<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down rapidly. This is a very common repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensor replaced as preventative maintenance due to the fact that the cost will be less when the technician is already there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
