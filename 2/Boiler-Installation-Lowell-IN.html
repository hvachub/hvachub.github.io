<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time.

We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
