<p>If the AC doesn't turn off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not release heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.

The two operations use various procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its aims.<p>
