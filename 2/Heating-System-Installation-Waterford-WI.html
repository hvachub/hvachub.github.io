<p>Air contaminants can range from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a common air pollutant arising from gas that leaves into your house without being burned off. Older homes may contain asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where moisture levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems.

Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
