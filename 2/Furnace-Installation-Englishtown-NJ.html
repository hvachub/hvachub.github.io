The Department of Energy's Energy Performance and Renewable resource area suggests that "Air Filtering must have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as figured out by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are used to decrease the quantity of dust that reaches the damp coils.

<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Since heating and cooling work might also need setting up or repairing pipes to supply oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might likewise be needed to hold a different plumbing professional's license or have a licensed plumber on call. Nevertheless, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this line of work. When getting a quote, make certain to ask not just if a company is licensed, but likewise what type of license it holds.<p>
