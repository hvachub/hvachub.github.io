<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne contaminants in their houses and get worse asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial structures, apartment buildings and large homes. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement expenses between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>
