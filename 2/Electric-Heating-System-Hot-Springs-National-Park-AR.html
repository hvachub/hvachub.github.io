<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most budget friendly if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
