<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
