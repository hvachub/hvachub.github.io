<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
