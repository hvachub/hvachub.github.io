<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
