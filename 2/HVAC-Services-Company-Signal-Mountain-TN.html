<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground over time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to work.<p>
