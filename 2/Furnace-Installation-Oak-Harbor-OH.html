<p>It prevails to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
