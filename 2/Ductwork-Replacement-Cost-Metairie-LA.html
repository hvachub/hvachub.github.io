<p>There are lots of reasons this can occur. The good news is that you can resolve a lot of these factors on your own without the requirement to require professional assistance.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
