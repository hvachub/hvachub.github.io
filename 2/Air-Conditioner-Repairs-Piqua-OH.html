<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for efficiency.

If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively straightforward process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey if you are including on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>

Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step.
