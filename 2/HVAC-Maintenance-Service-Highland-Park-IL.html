<p>I am very satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years back and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
