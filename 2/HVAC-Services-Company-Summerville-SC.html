<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Summerville SC</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We chose getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
