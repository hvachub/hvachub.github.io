Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient techniques of heating or cooling a home.
