<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective.
