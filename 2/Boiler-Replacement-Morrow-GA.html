<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature.
