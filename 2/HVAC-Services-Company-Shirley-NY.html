<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. Due to the fact that as much as 20% of the heat produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has an integrated efficiency benefit. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the see. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>

For instance, you can set the thermostat to decrease the heat when you're not in home to save money on the energy bills and ensure the system isn't overloaded. A professional technician will inspect the thermostat during the annual maintenance to make sure the real temperature and the temperature level on the thermostat matches. If there's a difference in the temperature, the technician needs to check the thermostat's performance or examine the whole HVAC system.<p>
