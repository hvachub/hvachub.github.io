<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time.
