Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
