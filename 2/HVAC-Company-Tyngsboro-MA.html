<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, numerous property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was set up many years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
