<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
