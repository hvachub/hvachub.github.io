<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
