<p>A geothermal heat pump is among the most energy efficient approaches of heating or cooling a house. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a home can be heated in cooler months by transferring and condensing energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels found just a few feet listed below ground. In the summer season, the procedure reverses, thereby cooling a home by removing heat. Underground temperature level remains continuous no matter the environment, so geothermal systems provide trustworthy and constant cooling and heating.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters regularly, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter as soon as every three months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>

<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
