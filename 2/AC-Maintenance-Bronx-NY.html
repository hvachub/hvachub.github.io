The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two significant components fail in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to offer sufficient changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
