<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a recommendation in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in gathering details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
