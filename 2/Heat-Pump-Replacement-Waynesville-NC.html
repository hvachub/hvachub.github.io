<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in Waynesville North Carolina</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the home.<p>
<p>A geothermal heat pump is one of the most energy efficient methods of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipelines, a house can be heated up in cooler months by condensing and transferring energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperature levels discovered just a few feet listed below ground. In the summer season, the process reverses, thereby cooling a house by eliminating heat. Underground temperature stays constant no matter the environment, so geothermal systems offer constant and trusted heating and cooling.<p>
