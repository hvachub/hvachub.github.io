<p>As kept in mind, incorrect temperature level and humidity levels, and insufficient or excessive air flow might also contribute to worker health grievances. Temperature levels ought to vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by too much air circulation should be avoided. Maintenance of correct temperature levels and humidity levels and proper air flow will help to minimize the occurrence of upper breathing symptoms, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent location to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
