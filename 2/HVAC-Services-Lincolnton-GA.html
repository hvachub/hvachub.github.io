<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly treat and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transmitted by animals and individuals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
