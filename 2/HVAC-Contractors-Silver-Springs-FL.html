<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
