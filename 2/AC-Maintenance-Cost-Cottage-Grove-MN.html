<h3>Choosing the Right Business For Heating and AC Systems at Cottage Grove MN</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. In addition, very dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
