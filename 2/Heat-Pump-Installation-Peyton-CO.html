<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure products, smoking cigarettes, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in manufactured items. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heatpump run on electrical power and work like a/c in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This enables them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating system (like an area heating unit) with the exact same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
