<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, merely including refrigerant is not an option. An experienced technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the proper amount of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and effectiveness of your a/c is biggest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's requirements, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>The very first a/c unit and fridges utilized flammable or toxic gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most utilized in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
