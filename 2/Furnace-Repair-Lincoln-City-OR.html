<p>Your air, ventilation, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) serve as a collection source for a range of pollutants that have the potential to adversely affect your health-- contaminants such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor needs to assess and, if required, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and fractures in the external walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating & cooling costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than replacing your equipment.<p>
<p>There are a great deal of benefits to using a radiant heat system over a traditional forced air heater. Radiant heat systems tend to be much more energy effective than other heating systems, for something. Required air heating systems tend to experience things like duct leakages, which rob them of as much as 30% of their output. Required air heating systems likewise tend to create hot and cold areas throughout your home, due to the nature of how warm air increases to the top of a space and sinks as it cools.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Regulation banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
