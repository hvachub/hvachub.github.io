<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Purcell OK?</h3>
<p>All modern air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
