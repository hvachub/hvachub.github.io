<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and various problems that didn't make any sense.

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them until they have been effectively dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up. If goods with a chemical odor are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
