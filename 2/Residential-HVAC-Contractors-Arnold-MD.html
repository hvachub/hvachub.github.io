<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out very same day to assess situation & decided to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating system which was old.
