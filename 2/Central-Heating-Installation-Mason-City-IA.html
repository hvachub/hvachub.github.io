<p>Measurement procedures are being established and shown to assess structure ventilation and indoor toxin concentrations. These treatments vary from advanced tracer gas methods used primarily in building research study efforts to less involved treatments that can be employed by constructing operators. NIST scientists are continually developing brand-new test treatments, and then showing them in the field to examine their feasibility and reliability. The efforts in which these treatments are demonstrated in the field has led to the advancement of a crucial database of building ventilation and indoor air quality performance.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one element (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Insufficient maintenance of the HVAC system also may contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may become clogged, lowering air circulation quality, volume, and distribution. They also may end up being places for bacteria and molds to grow and be distributed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be correctly kept to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
