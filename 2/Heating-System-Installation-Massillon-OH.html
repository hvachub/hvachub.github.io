When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most costly to set up.

In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to function.<p>
