<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is designed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure products, smoking cigarettes, household items, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heating systems. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in produced items. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and drapes, as an element of adhesives and glues, and as a preservative in some paints and finish items.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

<p>People have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint since these activities produce large amounts of lead dust. Consult your state health or housing department for ideas on which public companies or private labs might be able to help test your home for lead in paint.
