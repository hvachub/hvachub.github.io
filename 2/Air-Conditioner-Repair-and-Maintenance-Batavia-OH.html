<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and support in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
