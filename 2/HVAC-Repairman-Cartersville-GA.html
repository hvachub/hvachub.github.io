<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
