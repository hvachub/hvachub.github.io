<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
