<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home construction is to lower air leakage through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofs, and walls. The combination of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the home.<p>

If the sensor is knocked out of position, the air conditioning unit could cycle continuously or act erratically. The sensor must be near the coil but not touching it; adjust its position by thoroughly flexing the wire that holds it in place.<p>
