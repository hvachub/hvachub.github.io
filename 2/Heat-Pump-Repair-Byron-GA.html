<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
