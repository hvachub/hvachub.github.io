<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less common now than gas, but they can be helpful in more remote areas where utilities are more difficult to access, and in colder environments due to the fact that it provides more heat per BTU than other solutions. The installation cost will be lower, but energy expenses will be greater, as much as 3 times greater than gas or electric heaters. They require a storage tank on the immediate home and more maintenance. Overall, they cost between $2,000 and $8,000 to set up. Overall, they offer an AFUE score of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but your home doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
