<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types.

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system.

The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the air conditioning system works however your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
