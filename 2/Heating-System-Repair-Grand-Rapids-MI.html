The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
