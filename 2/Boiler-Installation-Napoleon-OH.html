<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by adding new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes emit toxins.) However, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation manual and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. A lot of units come with a set that includes adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will guarantee a safe and airtight  fit in the window opening. And for extra assistance, especially for larger air conditioning unit, think about acquiring a steel assistance bracket and mount it to the outside house wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>
