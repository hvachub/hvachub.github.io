<p>The predominant health impact associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
