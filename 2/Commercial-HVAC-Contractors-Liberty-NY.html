<p>Most Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they put a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's most likely your problem. The next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you found that your conditioning filter needs changing. The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
