<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outside unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2).
