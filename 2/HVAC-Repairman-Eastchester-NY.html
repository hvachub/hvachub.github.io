<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is triggered by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
