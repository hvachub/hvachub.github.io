Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to offer car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
