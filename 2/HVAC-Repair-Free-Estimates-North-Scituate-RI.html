These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
