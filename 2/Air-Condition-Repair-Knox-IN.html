<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide cosmetics air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside.

The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
