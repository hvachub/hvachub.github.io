The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
