<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat provides warmth from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>
