There are lots of ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
