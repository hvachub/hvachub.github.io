<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really practical in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started.
