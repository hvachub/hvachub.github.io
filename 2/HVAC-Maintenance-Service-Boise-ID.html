<p>Air contaminants can vary from pollutants generated from the outdoors by your animals to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air contaminant arising from gas that gets away into your house without being burnt. Older homes may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when launched into the air. In cooking areas and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where moisture levels are usually greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey discovered. Roughly 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
