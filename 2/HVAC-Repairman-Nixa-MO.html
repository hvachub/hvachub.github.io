<p>Variable speed is the method to go if it's time to update an aging AC. Currently planning to replace an existing air conditioning system? Assuming your spending plan accommodates a variable speed system, you need to definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summertime, and your indoor air will be great deal cleaner. At least, consider a 2 phase compressor for enhanced comfort and efficiency.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor.
