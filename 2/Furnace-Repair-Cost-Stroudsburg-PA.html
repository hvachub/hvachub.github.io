<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems in homes.

<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
