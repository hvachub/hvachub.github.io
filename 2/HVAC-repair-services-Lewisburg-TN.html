<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, but it is frequently utilized as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outdoors air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
