<p>There are some ranges of mold which contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins).

<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely specify the quantity (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that need to be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation combined with proper use of the exhaust system while painting or applying pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of poisonous fumes in the air.<p>
