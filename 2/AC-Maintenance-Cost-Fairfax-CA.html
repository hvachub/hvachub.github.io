<p>More common in reasonably older homes, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electricity, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in individual rooms.

More recent gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
