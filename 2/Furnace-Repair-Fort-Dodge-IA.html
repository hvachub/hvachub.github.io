<p>Sean was really handy. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level listed below the space temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
