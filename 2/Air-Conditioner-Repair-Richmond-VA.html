A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every three months. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
