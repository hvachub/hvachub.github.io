<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles.

<h3>Assessing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Ridgefield Park NJ</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing airflow.

In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
