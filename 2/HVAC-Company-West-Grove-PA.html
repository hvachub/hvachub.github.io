<p>A specialized a/c that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
