<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some people exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is proof that some individuals can develop a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde.

<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians believed they simply didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
