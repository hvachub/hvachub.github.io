<h3>Electric Heating in Bixby Oklahoma</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
