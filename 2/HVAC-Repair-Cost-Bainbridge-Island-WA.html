<h3>Local HVAC Companies in Bainbridge Island WA 98110</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>A cars and truck's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant ends up being old and unclean. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's performance. To make sure the system is working effectively, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is typically greater than many heat pump alternatives, they can still be highly efficient, depending on the design you buy. One of the primary benefits of gas heating is that due to the combustion process, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating options. This implies it can heat up your house to the desired temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
