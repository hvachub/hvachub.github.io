<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
