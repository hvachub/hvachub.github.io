<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building And Construction and Commissioning is developed for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning agents, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, smoking cigarettes, household items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of functions in manufactured items. For example, it is utilized to add permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finishing items.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task finding the outdoor unit as close to the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
