<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Monroe MI</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while concurrently getting rid of waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the harder it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly tough for your lungs to operate effectively, and can have negative health affects.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
