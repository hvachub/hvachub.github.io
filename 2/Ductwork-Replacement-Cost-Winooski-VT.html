<p>For whole house installations, it's tough, if almost impossible, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, particularly a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be utilized in one or a number of spaces like restrooms, kitchen areas or laundry rooms are easily remodelled with electric radiant floor heat.

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down prior to it has a possibility to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
