<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it. Any air flow limitation will lower the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very useful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heater, you may search for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end design to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally wish to look for a design that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one significant downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the extremely hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
