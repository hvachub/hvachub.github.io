<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
