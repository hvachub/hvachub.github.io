<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
