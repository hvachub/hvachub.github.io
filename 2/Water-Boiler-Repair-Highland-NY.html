<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Highland NY 12528</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
