<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

VOCs are organic chemicals released as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.
