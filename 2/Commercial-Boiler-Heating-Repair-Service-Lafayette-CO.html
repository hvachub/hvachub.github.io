<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to optimize the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (design levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold development and wetness inside your home is related to a higher frequency of occupant breathing issues.<p>
