Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and excessive moisture, introduces outdoors air, keeps interior structure air distributing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both should be kept clean. This suggests that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise essential to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
