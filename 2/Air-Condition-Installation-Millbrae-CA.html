<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They recommended replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part.

<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
