<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and disrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes inspecting the recommended connections in addition to temperature level and pressure gauges. Take time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>

Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After calling support, we dealt with problems. I would advise this product to anybody who's renovating or installing their restroom for the very first time.
