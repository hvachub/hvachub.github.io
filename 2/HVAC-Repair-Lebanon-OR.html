The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your home.

Likewise a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well with no fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other elements that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
