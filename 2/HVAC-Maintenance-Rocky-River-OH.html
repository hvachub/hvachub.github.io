<p>You're most likely hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can generally conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are great that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>

If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a good idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to examine your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter needs changing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c devices. The most convenient way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the system off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>

And practically 20 percent still smoke at home or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
