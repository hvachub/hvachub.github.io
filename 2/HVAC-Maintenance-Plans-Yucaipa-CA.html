<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in Yucaipa CA</h3>
<p>A split air conditioning system might cost near to that of a traditional HVAC system however has actually proven to be an alternative cost efficient option to homes that do not have ductwork.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
