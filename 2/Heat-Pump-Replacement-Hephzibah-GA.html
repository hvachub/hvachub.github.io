<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Don't place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it since it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will reduce the unit's performance. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
