<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could flatter two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>As with most house improvement jobs, the cost of a full central heater can differ commonly based on the size of the house. Most heaters will last between 15 and twenty years.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day.
