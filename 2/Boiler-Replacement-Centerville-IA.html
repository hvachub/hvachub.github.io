<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
