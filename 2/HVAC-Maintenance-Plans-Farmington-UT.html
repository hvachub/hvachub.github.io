<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur ought to pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the exact same in all other locations.<p>
