<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packaging product to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the traditional water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. It is most likely that it is supported by the pipes if the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank. If the tank or heat exchanger ever require to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
