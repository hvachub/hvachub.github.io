<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a variety of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually determined building materials, furnishings, and mold as major issues, however much of the risk likewise comes from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house.

Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
