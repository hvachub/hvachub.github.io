<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
