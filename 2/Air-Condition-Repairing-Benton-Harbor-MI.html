We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you buy.

If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
