Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
