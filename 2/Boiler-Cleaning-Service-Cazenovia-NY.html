<p>When mounting a wall sensor, consider the height at which they need to be positioned. Many commonly they are mounted at height-level or a little lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and stays near the floor.<p>
