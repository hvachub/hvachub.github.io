<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>It's a reality that a brand-new furnace for your home is among the more significant expenses involved in home ownership. However, it must also be viewed as a long-lasting investment. All of the latest heating systems are far more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years back. So, while it may appear like a short-term bigger expense, a brand-new, more energy-efficient home heating system will more than most likely save you cash in the longer-term by lowering your annual energy expenses.<p>
<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to briefly cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably effective and provided clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and home.<p>
