<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and particles in the air. As soon as every 3 months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
