<p>Professional heater installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will ultimately fail. HVAC specialists advise following this fundamental rule when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial structures, apartment buildings and large residences. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less susceptible to tear and use. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
