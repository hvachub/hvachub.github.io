<p>Air conditioning can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>

<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
