<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. He helped me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working once again. He is truthful, reputable, and sensible on rate. It's difficult to find an honest AC man and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality issues in large commercial buildings can not be efficiently determined or remedied without a detailed structure examination. These examinations might start with written surveys and telephone assessments in which building investigators evaluate the history of occupant symptoms and building operation treatments. In many cases, these inquiries may rapidly uncover the problem and on-site visits are unnecessary.<p>
<p>The most typical type of home heating unit in the U.S. burns natural gas or gas to produce heat. With an average cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive alternative, however newer systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems generally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly effective gas heating systems can accomplish AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
