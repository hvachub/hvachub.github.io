Loosen the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your vehicle. An unclean filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. When every three months, Energy Star suggests replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
