<h2>How To Hire Affordable HVAC Contractors in Flowery Branch</h2>

<p>Right now, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, affecting the air you breathe as well as the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. But many of the things individuals do-- or don't do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and aggravate asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators used hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
