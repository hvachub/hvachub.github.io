<p>How environment modification affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the ac system increase. This boost has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning unit gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
