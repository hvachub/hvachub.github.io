<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable concepts.

When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating aspects. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
