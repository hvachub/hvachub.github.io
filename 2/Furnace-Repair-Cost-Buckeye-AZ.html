<p>I have actually been utilizing Waychoff for about ten years. First, they repaired a bad installation from a previous company. Afterwards, they have kept my system semi-annually. Their techs are very educated and professional. Costs are reasonable. Always on time, and call when they are on their method. Waychoff installed a new air handler and condenser today. I did not bother to get rival's quotes due to the fact that of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was certainly reasonable.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a pipe two times a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electrical power open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
