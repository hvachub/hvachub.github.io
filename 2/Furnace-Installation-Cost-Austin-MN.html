<p>Most central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
