<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
