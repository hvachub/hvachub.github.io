<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
