<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures continuously evolve as a result of the modifications in the environment around them along with the residents, products, and activities within them. The different surface areas and the air inside a building are constantly communicating, and this interaction results in changes in each. For example, we might see a window as changing slightly gradually as it ends up being dirty, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life. In reality, the dirt" we see may be progressing as a result of the interactions amongst the moisture, chemicals, and biological products found there.<p>
