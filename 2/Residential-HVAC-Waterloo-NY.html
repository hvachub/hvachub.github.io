<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary issue. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
