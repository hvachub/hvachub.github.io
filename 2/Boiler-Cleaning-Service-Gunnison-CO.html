<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
