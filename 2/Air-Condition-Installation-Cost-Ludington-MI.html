<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
