Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
