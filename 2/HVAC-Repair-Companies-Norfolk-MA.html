<h3>Hot Water Heating System in Norfolk MA 02056</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
