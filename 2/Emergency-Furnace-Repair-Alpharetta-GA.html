<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are available.

Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>Many disconnect blocks contain two cartridge merges. Inspect them before you continue with repairs (Photo 3). A blown fuse suggests a stopping working part inside the condensing unit.

If it blows once again, call a pro-- you've got more major problems.<p>
