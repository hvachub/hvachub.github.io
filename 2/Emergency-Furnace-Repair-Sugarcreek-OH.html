<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
