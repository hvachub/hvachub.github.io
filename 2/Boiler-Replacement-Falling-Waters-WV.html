The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit service consultations include a long list of checks in, on and around your devices.
