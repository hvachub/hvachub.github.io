<p>Use professionals and treat them well: Inspired, well-compensated professionals carry out far better work than short-term subcontractors who have little stake in a company's success.

<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type response in individuals who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For example, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, however not in those people who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent irritant. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Contaminated central air handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
