<h3>Effective Tips for Furnace Cleaning at Prairie Grove AR</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window plan units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
