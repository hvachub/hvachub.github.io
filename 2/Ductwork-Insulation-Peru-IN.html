There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled.

Do not accept them up until they have actually been correctly dried if dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
