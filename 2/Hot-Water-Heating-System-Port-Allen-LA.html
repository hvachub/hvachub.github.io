<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year earlier and they have actually been to the house for a system tune-up 3 times now. They're priced fairly, have dealt with the one repair I required well, and are expert and constantly on-time. Have been through a couple of companies for many years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I have actually had the opportunity to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been excellent.<p>
<p>A/c makers generally make rugged, high quality items. Begin by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the system cool down for about five minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pressing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
