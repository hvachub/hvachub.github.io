<h3>Is Your Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in New Fairfield CT?</h3>
<p>I admit I haven't done the math lately, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that assurance.<p>

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the quantity of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is usually routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
