<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, cars such as cars and trucks, trains, submarines, airplanes and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
