However, better brand names typically come with a longer life-span, better warranties, and smarter technology built in to totally manage your home's temperature.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as medical facilities and skyscrapers, cars such as cars and trucks, trains, submarines, airplanes and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with respect to temperature and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>

This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
