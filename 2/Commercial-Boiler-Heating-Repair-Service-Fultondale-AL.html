<p>The directions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same.

Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom floor.<p>
