<p>Fantastic Item! Shipment was sort of odd being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes time to use. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed problems. I would suggest this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material acquired with your house. This company presented a service arrangement contract to supply service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on an extremely cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health hazard factor and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new homeowner I have learned how to recognize the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<h3>Choosing Commercial HVAC Repair Services at Los Gatos CA</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require reasonably little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is vital to keep the system operating smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank must be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in hard water locations). The systems should be inspected a minimum of two times annually for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to eliminate dust gathered in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a consumer you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the system has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
