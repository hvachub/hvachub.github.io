And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
