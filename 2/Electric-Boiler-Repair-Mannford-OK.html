That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
