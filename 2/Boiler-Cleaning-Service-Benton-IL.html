PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This reduces the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems might be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room cooling provides optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
