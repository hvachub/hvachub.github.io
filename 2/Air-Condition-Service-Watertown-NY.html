In addition, locals must look out to the development of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization steps should not be undertaken until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Through normal use and the unit's presence outside, the coils and fins of the air conditioner might end up being very dirty.
