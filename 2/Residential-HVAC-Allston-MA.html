<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>How to Limit the Costs of Air Conditioner Repair at Allston MA</h3>
<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even little window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions necessitate. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
