<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur over time due to the fact that of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
