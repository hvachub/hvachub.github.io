OSHA, NIOSH and others have actually set NO2 requirements, and the World Health Company (WHO) has actually set standards for both-- including for indoor air.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas.
