<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
