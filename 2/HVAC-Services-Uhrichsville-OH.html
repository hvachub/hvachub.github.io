<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>This lacked a doubt the best and most rewarding service me and my wife have ever received. First and foremost the professionals arrived here precisely when they said that they would. Their rates was straight in line with the level of service that was provided also, the specialists described exactly what they were looking and doing for every single step of the method while they were here. They also helped us set up a certain service plan that in the long run will assist us conserve cash.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are often more difficult to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may pick to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency system. Speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system if you do so. However, considering current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it may be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
