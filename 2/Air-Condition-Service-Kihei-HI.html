Lots of typical building products used prior to 1975 include asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipeline wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products.

<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heater.

<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Irritants are products that cause an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are easily inhaled. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized individuals with asthma can trigger asthma attacks. For example, if you consider a group of people with asthma, the existence of feline irritant might cause an asthma attack in people with feline allergic reactions, but not in those individuals who do not have feline allergic reactions.<p>
<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an option for property owners to consider. Often times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. In addition, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best option for house owners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
