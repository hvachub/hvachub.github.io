<p>I am really impressed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the value of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high adequate temperature level, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
