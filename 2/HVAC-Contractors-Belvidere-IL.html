<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was very handy in gathering info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and offered clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and house.<p>
