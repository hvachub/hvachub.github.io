<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Lyman SC 29365</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
