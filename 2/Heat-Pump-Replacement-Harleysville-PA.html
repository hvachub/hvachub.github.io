<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>These men have been fantastic. At a realtor, I in some cases need contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house may cost. Just recently I needed to call on these men two times.

Integrity isn't just their name, it's a service design they take seriously. You people are formally on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>
