<p>For a heated floor location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
<p>It might feel relaxing being sealed in tight against the cold in your home throughout the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are sensitive to indoor allergens or have respiratory issues, winter can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather condition it is essential to be familiar with some of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that might be prowling in your environments.<p>
