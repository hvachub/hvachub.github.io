<p>I generally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
