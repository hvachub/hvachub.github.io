<p>The quality of the air inside our work environments, homes and schools matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside. A/c unit assist to dehumidify the incoming air, but in exceptionally humid environments or in cases where the a/c unit is large, it might not accomplish a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your home. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>
<p>A/c producers generally make rugged, high quality products. If your a/c stops working, start by checking any fuses or breaker. Let the system cool down for about 5 minutes prior to resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limit switch might have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>

Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.

Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
