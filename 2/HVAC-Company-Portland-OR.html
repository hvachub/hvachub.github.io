<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
