<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the average house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the overall heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.<p>
