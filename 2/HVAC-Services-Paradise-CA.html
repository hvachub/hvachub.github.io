<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might discover unpleasant or musty smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.
