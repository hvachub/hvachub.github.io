<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenses prior to paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective.
