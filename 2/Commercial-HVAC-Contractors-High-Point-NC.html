<p>There is no simple answer, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, replacing is most likely a better option.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can in some cases be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this information might recognize potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of data may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
