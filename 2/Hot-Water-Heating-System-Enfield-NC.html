<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
