<h3>Advantages of Expert AC Repair in Levittown PA</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air conditioning, you have a few options when it concerns central heating systems. We'll delve into costs later, however you can pick from a boiler, furnace or heat  pump. In general, heaters are the most cost effective choice. However, your choice will mainly boil down to what your ducts allow or what was formerly in your house. Ask your heating contractor for the most suitable option.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living spaces and kitchen areas through the vents or registers.<p>
