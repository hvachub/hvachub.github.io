<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
