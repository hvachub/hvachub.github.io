<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
