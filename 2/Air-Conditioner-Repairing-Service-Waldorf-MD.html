<h3>Ductless AC System in Waldorf Maryland</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated up, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
