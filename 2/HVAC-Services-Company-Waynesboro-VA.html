<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heat pumps run on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heater) with the same amount of electricity. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>There are some more serious threats for HVAC employees that might be potentially deadly. They can be exposed to Carbon Monoxide which can be toxic.

Although there are dangers related to the task, it is normally performed securely as long as correct care is taken.<p>
<p>Additionally, house owners have a range of alternatives to pick from in powering a flooring heater. Radiant systems are compatible with electrical, natural gas, solar and even geothermal energy sources. As many homeowners are all too aware, tradition furnace systems are generally limited to working on a single energy source, such as heating oil. If the market for that energy source turns unstable, rates can fluctuate, rates surge and you can end up paying more to heat your house regardless of how low you set your thermostat.<p>
