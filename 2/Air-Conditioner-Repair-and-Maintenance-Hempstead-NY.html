Allergens discovered in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can end up being airborne, and thus, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think of a group of people with asthma, the presence of feline irritant might induce an asthma attack in people with cat allergic reactions, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
