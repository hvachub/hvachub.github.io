<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Wilkesboro NC</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy performance. Sometimes, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended vehicle service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the needed abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
