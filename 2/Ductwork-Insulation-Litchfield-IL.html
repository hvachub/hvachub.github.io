<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
