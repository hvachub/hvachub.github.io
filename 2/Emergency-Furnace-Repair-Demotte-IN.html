<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<h3>Home Furnace in Demotte IN 46310</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
