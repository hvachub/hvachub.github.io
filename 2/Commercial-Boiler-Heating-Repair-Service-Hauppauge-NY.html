Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made items. For instance, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and drapes, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air conditioning system is thought about to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioners are more energy effective than designs made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's 5 years of ages or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while delivering the exact same amount of cooling.<p>

But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
