<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated hold-up features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that measure the height and width of the opening. Be sure to have those measurements on hand when buying an air conditioning unit to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to set up the air conditioning unit: Do not put it in an egress window that functions as the only ways of escape ought to a fire appear.<p>
