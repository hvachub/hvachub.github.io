<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air.

Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
