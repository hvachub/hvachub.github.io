<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can likewise present wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
