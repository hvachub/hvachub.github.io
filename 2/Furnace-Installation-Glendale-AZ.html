An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>

Newer gas boilers should accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
