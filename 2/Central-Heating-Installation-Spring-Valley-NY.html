<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold may be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and cooling system.

<h3>Is Your Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Spring Valley NY?</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
