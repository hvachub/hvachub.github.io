<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Huntington WV</h3>
<p>For whole house setups, it's challenging, if nearly difficult, to retrofit a radiant heat system in an existing house, specifically a hydronic system. Localized glowing flooring heat systems to be used in one or numerous spaces like restrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are easily renovated with electric radiant floor heat. This is much more cost-effective on a smaller scale. Larger remodellings like additions to a house may be suitable for a bigger scale and more pricey hydronic system.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He knew just what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
