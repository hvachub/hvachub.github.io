<p>If you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and no one else could come other than for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My spouse stated that she had actually seen a great review for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and described the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He used to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most decent individuals I have met in a long time. If we wish to have options to ACME heating, we require to support the real people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
