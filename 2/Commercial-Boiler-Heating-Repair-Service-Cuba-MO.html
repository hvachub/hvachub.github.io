<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outside and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
