<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
