<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
