Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, however lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also cause cancers.

The EPA advises humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working properly. He needed to go get the correct replacement.
