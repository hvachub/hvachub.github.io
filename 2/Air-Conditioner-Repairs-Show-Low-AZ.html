When ventilation is not adequate to account for a boost in the number of employees in the location, stagnant air might also be a problem.<p>
<p>Some health effects might appear soon after a single exposure or duplicated exposures to a contaminant.

Sometimes the treatment is just removing the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined.

Permeable products, ceiling, flooring, and wall coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 2 days may end up being a source for mold growth and ought to be disposed of. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Fix the moisture issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing established health department suggestions.<p>
