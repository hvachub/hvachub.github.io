<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, schools and houses matters, especially since we invest the majority of our lives indoors. Ac system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in very humid climates or in cases where the ac system is extra-large, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will need more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
