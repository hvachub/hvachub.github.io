<p>There are two main forms of radiant floor heating, or RFH as it's known in the home heating company. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some type of a fuel-fired boiler and is then distributed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cable televisions set under the flooring are forced to withstand existing, which then generates heat.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
