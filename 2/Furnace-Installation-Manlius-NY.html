<p>Indoor air pollution comes from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined building materials, furnishings, and mold as severe issues, however much of the threat likewise originates from burning things. For instance, smoking cigarettes or burning wood for heating or cooking can produce pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge problem in the developing world.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with poor IAQ may see musty or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems.

However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent structure management.<p>
