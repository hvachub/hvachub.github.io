Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
