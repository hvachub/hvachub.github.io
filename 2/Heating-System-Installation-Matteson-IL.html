<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
