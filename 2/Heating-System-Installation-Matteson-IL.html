<p>How climate change impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the a/c boost. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
