<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Repair in Mc Calla Alabama</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait on the AC to begin (see Be Patient at Startup," listed below). The compressor ought to run and the condenser fan should spin. The fan motor is most likely shot if the compressor begins however the fan doesn't. Turn off the power and eliminate the screws around the condenser cover.

If  it does not, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
