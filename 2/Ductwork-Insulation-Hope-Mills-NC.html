<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets ask for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, much of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
