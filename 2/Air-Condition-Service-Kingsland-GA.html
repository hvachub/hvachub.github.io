He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and understand the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
