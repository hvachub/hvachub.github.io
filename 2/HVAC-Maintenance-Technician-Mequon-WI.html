<p>AC systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

The typical set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
