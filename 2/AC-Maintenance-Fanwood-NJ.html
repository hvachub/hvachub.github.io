<p>Structures are designed or meant to react actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sterilize, and maintain surface areas to boost their performance, appearance, or longevity. In other cases, such changes subtly or even considerably modify structures in ways that may be very important to their own stability or their influence on structure residents through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may find it beneficial to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, a few of the approaches used by researchers studying communities, in order to acquire an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two essential impacts. In other cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends upon specific sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after duplicated direct exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and building occupants may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the form of gases and particles) from workplace makers, cleaning products, construction carpets, furnishings and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged building products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside toxins. Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
