<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
