(If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we elected to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
