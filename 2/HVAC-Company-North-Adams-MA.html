<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in North Adams MA</h3>
<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it goes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a colorless, odor free gas that interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can trigger unconsciousness and death.

The symptoms of carbon monoxide gas poisoning are sometimes puzzled with the influenza or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, senior individuals, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory disease can be specifically sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures.<p>
