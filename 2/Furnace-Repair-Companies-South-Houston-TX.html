<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
