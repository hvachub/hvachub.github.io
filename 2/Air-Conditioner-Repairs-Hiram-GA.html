<p>The federal government advises that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must likewise be required to minimize pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.)

<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide should be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for computations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
