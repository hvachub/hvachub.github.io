<p>Improve your services, earn more services revenue, and offer an amazing consumer experience. To ensure the unit you choose is the right size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to figure out the specific kind of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we don't just replace it with the very same size system you currently have.

I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
