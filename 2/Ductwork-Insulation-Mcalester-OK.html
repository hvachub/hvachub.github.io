<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
