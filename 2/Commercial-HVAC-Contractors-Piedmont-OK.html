VOCs are organic chemicals discharged as gases from products or processes; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Normal sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water usage.<p>
