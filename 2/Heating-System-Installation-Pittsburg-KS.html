<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
