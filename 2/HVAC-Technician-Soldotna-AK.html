<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All circuitry for your radiant heat system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, particularly if you reside in a place that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop carrying out as you expect it to if they're not cleaned and replaced frequently. The heating and cooling will mishandle and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Checking and altering the air filters is one of the most essential elements of HVAC maintenance.<p>
