Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
