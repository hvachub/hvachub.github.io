<p>All Points Heating provides home cooling, a/c installation, air conditioner maintenance that deliver reliable, proven performance at high effectiveness.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>
