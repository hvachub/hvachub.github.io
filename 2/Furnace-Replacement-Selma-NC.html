<p>Radiant heating covers a variety of various heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles.

In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

Allergens discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold.
