<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely valuable in gathering information on the phone and providing clear instructions about how to temporarily handle the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its remedies, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will definitely use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
