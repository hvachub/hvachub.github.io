<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works but your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>

During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
