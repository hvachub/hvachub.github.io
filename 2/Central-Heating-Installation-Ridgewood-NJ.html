<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
