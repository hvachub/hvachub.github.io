<p>Learn about PSR Mechanical. The effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects toxins from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less efficient collector. The long-term efficiency of any air cleaner depends on keeping it according to the maker's instructions.<p>
<p>Not all sensing units work the very same method; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're dealing with a Web of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensor information to the cloud, where you can access it via software. You get instant, real-time access to the monitoring results via a dashboard, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to analyze.<p>
