<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, an oversize compressor also costs more to run. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
