<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- because they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for example, or the burning of fossil fuels, participates in structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will definitely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
