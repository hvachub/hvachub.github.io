<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
