<p>I usually don't leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>
