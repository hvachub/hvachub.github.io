<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Aiea HI 96701</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't provide off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen over time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay.
