<p>Seattle heaters can run 9 months of the year. Based upon the typical temperature levels in our location, if you compared running your furnace to a car it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its anticipated life-span of 15 years.

<p>They were terrific! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs entirely by providing an expert quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also promptly followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
