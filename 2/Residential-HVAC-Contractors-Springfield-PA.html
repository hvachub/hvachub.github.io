<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in Springfield Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth.

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Springfield PA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on numerous home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the required electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
