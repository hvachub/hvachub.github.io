Radiant systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared clinical principle used by the sun called view." These invisible electromagnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In an included system like a house, the warmer things naturally heat the cooler ones till a balance is attained.<p>

<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
