<h3>Outdoor Air Conditioner in Kenmore WA 98028</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
