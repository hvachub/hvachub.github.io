<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

Not just was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more enhanced.

<p>Through typical usage and the unit's existence outside, the coils and fins of the a/c might end up being very unclean. These aspects of the equipment are essential for effective air conditioning. The technician cleans all components, and examines connections to ensure they are safe. The system is charged with refrigerant, and all electronic components are examineded for proper function and overall condition. This is an outstanding chance to determine parts that are worn or malfunctioning. When the problem is fairly minor, changing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot less expensive.<p>
