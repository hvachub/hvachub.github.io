<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal effectiveness will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is currently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much bigger AC system than a smaller home, which will impact installation expenses. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will require far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become blocked with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down completely. By comparison, examining and replacing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in just a few minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
