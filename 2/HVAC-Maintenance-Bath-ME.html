<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around since the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to flow hot water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat moved heat to other short articles in the spaces, consisting of the human residents.<p>
