<p>Power Vac America provides commercial, commercial, institutional, residential and marine air duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning company. The essential part of your cooling is the outdoor system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending on its placement on your property and its maintenance, it might sustain some damage throughout the winter season. The majority of the time, this simply consists of some accumulation of dirt and particles, which is pretty simple to eliminate. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will wipe the outside of the system and guarantee that there is no rust, damage from accumulated moisture, or excessive wear to the exterior. They may recommend that you trim back thick trees or bushes to make sure sufficient air flow around the system.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
