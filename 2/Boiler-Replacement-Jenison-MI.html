<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most heating systems have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control board should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.
