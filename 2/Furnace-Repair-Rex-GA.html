<p>Indoor air pollution is triggered by burning strong fuel sources - such as firewood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary considerably from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last.

Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
