This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
