<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Items HVAC Repairin Junction City OR</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility costs. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to protect your investment by only utilizing the services of a licensed contractor or a certified representative from a company or seller to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the guarantee for the cooling system. A voided guarantee will not do you any good must the system fail or breakdown. Do it right from the start and work with a licensed individual with the experience to set up the system.<p>
