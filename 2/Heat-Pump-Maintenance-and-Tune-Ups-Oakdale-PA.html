<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, reduced attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Infants, children, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the damaging effects of lead.

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very extensive in discussing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn supplied terrific client service at the end of the consultation by discussing exactly what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of ideas of some maintenance jobs we might want to have done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the market.<p>
