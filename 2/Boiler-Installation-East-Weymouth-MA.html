<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach balance in temperature after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
