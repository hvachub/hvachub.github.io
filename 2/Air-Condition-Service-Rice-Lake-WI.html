<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
