<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However many of the things people do-- or do not do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne pollutants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergies, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heater, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
