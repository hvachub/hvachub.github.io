<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from moisture.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>
