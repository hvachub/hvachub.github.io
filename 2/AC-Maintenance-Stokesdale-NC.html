Don't put the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it since it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow constraint will lower the unit's effectiveness. You can, nevertheless, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why spaces heated by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and extremely hot beside the radiators.
