<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they offer me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
