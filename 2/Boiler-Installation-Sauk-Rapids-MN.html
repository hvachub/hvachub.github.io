<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture, Air cleaning happens. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect essential in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
