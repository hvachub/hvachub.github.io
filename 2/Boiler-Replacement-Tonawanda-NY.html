Structures constantly develop as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them as well as the occupants, products, and activities within them.

<p>Truth: Federal and local incentives usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with traditional devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new building and construction (homes generally use between one and five heaps). Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is gotten rid of. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the space is in fact heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
