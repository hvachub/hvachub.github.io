<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor home appliances through codes, and after stronger standards are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at threat. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might trigger countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition intensified by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a much better service.
