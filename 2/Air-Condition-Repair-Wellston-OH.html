<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the bigger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some fundamental maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants streaming through your system. They can also keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from accumulating on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the space without any cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
