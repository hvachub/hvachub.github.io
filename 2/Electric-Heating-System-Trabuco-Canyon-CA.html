<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2).
