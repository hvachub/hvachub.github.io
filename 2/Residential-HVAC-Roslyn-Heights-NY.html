<p>We called Elite HVACS on among the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out exact same day to evaluate situation & chose to go with them for the work.

<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an option for homeowners to think about. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save money on a total HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
