<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to purchase extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault.

The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
