<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the boost it needs from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has stopped working. In some cases you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are excellent that this might work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
