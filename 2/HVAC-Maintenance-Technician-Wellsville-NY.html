<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Many aspects affect IAQ. These elements consist of poor ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a building that can impact the fresh air entering the building. Often, specific impurities like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals released as a gas in time) might cause bad IAQ.<p>
