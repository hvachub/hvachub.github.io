<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually.
