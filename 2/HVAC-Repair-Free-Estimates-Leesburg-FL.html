<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a damaging environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " top environmental hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of ways in which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other items.<p>
<p>Compounding the noted health signs might be task stress. In part, due to numerous aspects of workplace automation, the most demanding aspects of office work are increasing.

<p>Recent Evaluation: They were excellent! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs completely by offering a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional products.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
