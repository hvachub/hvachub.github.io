<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
