<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a different split system, employees try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
