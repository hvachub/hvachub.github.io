<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly consider anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The noise level is itâ and low $ s great on energy saving too.<p>

However more complex issues-- identified by consistently unacceptable air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack.
