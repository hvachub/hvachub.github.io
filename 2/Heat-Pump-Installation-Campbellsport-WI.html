<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Basics in Campbellsport WI</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you would not use them.  Secondly like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
