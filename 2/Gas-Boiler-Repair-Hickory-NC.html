<h3>Things to Search for When Selecting an Hickory NC HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the ac system before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
