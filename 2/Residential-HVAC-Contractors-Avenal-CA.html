Gas furnace not blowing hot air? Simply as with switches, somebody might have shut off a gas valve and after that forgotten to turn it back on. Trace the gas line back from the furnace to the meter, and if you see a handle that's perpendicular to the gas pipe, turn it so it's parallel.

<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
