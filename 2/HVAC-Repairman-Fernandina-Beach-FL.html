<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer.

The estimation is relatively simple to perform and will reveal what size unit you require. Proceed to another contractor if the one you're considering wants to determine the right unit for your home solely on experience. Though strongly influenced by where you live, several factors impact the size system needed, consisting of the quantity of wall and attic insulation you have; the types and placement of doors and windows; and the orientation of your home to the sun.
