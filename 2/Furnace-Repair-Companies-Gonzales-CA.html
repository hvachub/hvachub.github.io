These estimations think about things such as the size of your home, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is vital so the system isn't too large-both or too small waste energy.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
