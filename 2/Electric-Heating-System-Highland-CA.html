<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
