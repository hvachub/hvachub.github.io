<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
