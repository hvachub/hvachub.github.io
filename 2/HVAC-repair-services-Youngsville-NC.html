<h3>Home AC Repair in Youngsville North Carolina</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally unusual now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
