<p>SysTech Design specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
<p>The EPA suggests that you have your duct checked by an expert heating and cooling contractor. If your technician finds that your air ducts have considerable mold, dust, dirt, and other impurities or a moldy smell, they may suggest duct cleaning This is particularly important if someone in your home has asthma, allergic reactions, or other symptoms that might be related to indoor air contamination.<p>
