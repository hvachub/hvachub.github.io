<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in New Castle PA</h3>
<p>Even more recent heaters less than five years of ages have actually been found as bad. Too many house owners are shocked to discover that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
