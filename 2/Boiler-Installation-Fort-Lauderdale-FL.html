<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
<p>For instance, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outside air.

Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can likewise generate air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological contaminants that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning unit, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>
