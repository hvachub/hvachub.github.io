<p>Sean was really useful. He is a very enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault.

<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Glasgow KY 42141</h3>
<p>While pollutant levels from individual sources might not pose a significant health risk on their own, many houses have more than one source that contributes to indoor air contamination. There can be a severe threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to lower the threat from existing sources and to avoid new issues from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can reduce the level of indoor air contamination in your own home.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with poor IAQ might see moldy or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no substitute for good building management.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
