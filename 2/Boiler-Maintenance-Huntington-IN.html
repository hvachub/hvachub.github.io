<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
