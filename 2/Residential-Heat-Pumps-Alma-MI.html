Likewise, real estate prices in Seattle have escalated, and as an outcome, newer houses are getting taller and skinnier, with bed rooms on the upper levels. Many attics are likewise being converted to complete bed rooms to add additional space. Rooms in the upper locations of houses are particularly vulnerable to getting incredibly hot and uncomfortable during the summer, making air conditioning a lot more needed.<p>
