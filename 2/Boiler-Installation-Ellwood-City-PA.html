<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become a crucial concern to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution studies have determined several contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These include combustion items, unpredictable natural substances (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are necessary in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
