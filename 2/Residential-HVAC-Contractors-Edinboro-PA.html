<p>I'll start with a natural gas furnace because it's the most typical heater in Seattle homes.

If your house already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a relatively simple process. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather costly if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
