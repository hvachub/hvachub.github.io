<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>How To Get Rid of Boiler Issues in Tarboro NC</h3>
<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the job based just on emails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my house and installed the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Since an a/c moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in damage to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
