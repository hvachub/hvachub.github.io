<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run because it needs to run longer than a properly sized unit. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate since it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
