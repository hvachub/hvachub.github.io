<h3>Truth All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Rochester MN</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The team took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>

That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a possibility to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
