<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
