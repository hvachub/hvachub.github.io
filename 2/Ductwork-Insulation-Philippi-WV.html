<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great.

<p>I have actually been using them for years for my services, my own homes and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on cost. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
