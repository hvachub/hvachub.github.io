<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floors, fractures in concrete walls and floors, floor drains, and sumps. When radon becomes caught in concentrations and structures develop inside, exposure to radon becomes a concern.<p>
<h3>HVAC Technician in Wahiawa Hawaii</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination issue exists. Extreme re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions. Stale air has greater levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of employees in the area, stale air may also be a problem.<p>
<p>Geothermal air conditioning is a cost-effective and smart way to cool down your house or workplace when the temperatures keep climbing up. But when your AC system quits working efficiently or starts to breakdown, you need an experienced contractor to come in and get it repaired as quickly as possible. Which's where we can assist. At All The Time A/c & Heating, Inc. in Rye Brook, NY, we provide geothermal a/c repair services to commercial and residential customers alike.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, indicating they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as a car radiator or common household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
