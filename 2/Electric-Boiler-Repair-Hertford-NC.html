<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
