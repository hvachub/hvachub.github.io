<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from improperly placed or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outside fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
