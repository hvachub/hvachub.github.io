<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
