<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
