<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
