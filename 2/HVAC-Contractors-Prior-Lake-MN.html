<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must briefly change back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
