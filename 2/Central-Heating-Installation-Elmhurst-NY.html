<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Eliminate the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
