<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
