<p>WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, flooring, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can prosper in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
