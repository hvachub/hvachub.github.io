The existing trend in house building is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, roofing systems, and walls. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor impurities and assists exhaust them from the home.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by construction, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your danger of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
