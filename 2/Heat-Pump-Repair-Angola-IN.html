<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product with time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
