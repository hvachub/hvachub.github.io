<p>A SEER rating stands for Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
