<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Floyds Knobs IN 47119</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. Over time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that takes place, you wish to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
