<h3>HVAC System in Urbandale IA 50322</h3>
<p>All heater have some level of air purification. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne contaminants flowing through your system. They can likewise keep your system carrying out well by helping in reducing the accumulation of dust, dirt and other particles from building up on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

Send for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more details about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water.

High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
