<p>Particular immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often challenging to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to take note of the time and place the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could grovel two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a few years back.<p>
