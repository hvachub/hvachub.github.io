<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Decatur GA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the entire day as they required to remove the old hot water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We decided on getting something more pricey than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant energy costs. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

To put it simply, in-floor heater supply a various mode and level of comfort. And, as numerous public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfy we feel, the more inclined we might be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>
