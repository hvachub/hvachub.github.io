<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
