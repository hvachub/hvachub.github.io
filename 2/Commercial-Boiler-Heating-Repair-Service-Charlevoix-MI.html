Heating systems that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
