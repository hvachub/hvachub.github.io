<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
