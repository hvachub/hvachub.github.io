<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of direct exposure is through the development of an aerosol impact, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which might get in nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside water fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
