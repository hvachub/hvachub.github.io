<p>A customized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the same air path. A standard a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside.
