<p>A third way to decide whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to take a look at your lifestyle and activities.

Signs that can indicate your house may not have adequate ventilation include wetness condensation on walls or windows, foul-smelling or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products end up being musty.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
