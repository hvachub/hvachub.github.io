<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as crucial as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
