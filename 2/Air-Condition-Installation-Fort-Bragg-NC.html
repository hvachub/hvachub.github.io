Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not really energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the home.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold.
