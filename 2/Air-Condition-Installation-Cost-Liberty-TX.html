<p>The purpose of the majority of building ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and constructing security at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is referred to as the Manual J calculation and ought to be performed by the HVAC contractor before giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone. Just like determining the size of a system needed based on BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of system for your house also depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside your home is connected with a higher frequency of resident breathing issues.<p>
