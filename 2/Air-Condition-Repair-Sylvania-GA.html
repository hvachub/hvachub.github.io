<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Sylvania GA</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Numerous aspects affect IAQ.

Often, specific impurities like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals launched as a gas in time) may cause bad IAQ.<p>
