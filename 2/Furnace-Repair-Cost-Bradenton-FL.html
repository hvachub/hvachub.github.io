<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of common cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Loosen the old AC contactor before getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Picture 6).<p>
<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Bradenton Florida</h3>
<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
