<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you should watch out for. First, you ought to examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
