<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Since it tires warm air out the top, don't position the condenser under a deck or completely confine it. Any air flow restriction will lower the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
