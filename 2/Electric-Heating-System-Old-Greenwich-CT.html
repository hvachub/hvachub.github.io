<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>I have been utilizing them for many years for my businesses, my own homes and my property customers' houses. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He assisted me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again. He is truthful, trustworthy, and sensible on cost. It's hard to find a truthful AC guy and I'm glad I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>

However, pick your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales techniques that DO make the most of uninformed property owners.

While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be working with a trustworthy company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same).
