This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Recognizing the Dangers of a Propane Furnace in Whitesburg KY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
