<p>Examine these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your home are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the reduced airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house.
