<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Easthampton MA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really happy that someone as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: employ Blue Flame to test the ac system prior to you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
