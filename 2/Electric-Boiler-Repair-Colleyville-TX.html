<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future.
