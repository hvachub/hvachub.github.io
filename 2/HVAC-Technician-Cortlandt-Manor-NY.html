According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
