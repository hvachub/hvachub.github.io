<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many hazardous impacts, there is significant unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are necessary to produce particular illness. People also respond extremely in a different way to exposure to indoor air pollutants.

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
