Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make certain that a reliable moisture barrier is set up prior to setting up the carpet.

Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine elements. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, go to Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
