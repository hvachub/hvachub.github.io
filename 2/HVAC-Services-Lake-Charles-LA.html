<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its initial box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have two major components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
