<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
