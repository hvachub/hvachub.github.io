Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system independently, since the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are generally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity.
