A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>

<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.
