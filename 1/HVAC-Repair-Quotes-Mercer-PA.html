<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the rate excellent however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
