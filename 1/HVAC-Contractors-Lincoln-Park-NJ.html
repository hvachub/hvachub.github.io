<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
