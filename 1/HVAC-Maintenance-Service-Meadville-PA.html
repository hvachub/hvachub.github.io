<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They advised changing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast web search validated WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Meadville PA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions. He dedicated to the task based only on emails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex correctly encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 system it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
