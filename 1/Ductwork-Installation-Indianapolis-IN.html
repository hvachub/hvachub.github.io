<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and very hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies warmth from the floor up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the location being heated up.<p>
