<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, many frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from badly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might enter neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually included outside fountains in public attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
