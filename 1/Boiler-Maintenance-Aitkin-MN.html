<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating unit can also be connected to a gadget referred to as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat generated from the ground source heatpump compressor and utilizes it to heat water. This indicates that this gadget can also provide complimentary hot water for domestic usage in addition to its traditional geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
