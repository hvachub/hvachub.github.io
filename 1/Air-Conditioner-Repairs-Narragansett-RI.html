<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and connected them into a hot water supply, glowing heat systems have been around because the days of the Romans.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
