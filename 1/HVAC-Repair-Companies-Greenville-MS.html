<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
