<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems run on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each room.
