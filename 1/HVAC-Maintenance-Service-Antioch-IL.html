<h3>Air Condition Installation Near Me in Antioch Illinois</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>This is my third time utilizing Around the Clock.

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
