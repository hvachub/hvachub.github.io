<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>EER represents Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>To start, it's an excellent idea to think of energy efficiency. By picking a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency ranking as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and conserve cash in the long run. Effectiveness ratings must be labeled with all units. While effective units may cost more, opting for an Energy Star-rated appliance is a great way to take pleasure in additional peace of mind.<p>
