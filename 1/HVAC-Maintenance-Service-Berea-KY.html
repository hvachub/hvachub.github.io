<p>Geothermal heatpump cost is far more than other heat pump types when installing the whole system. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Installing one involved excavation, running numerous yards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is rather costly.

<p>Gas heaters do come with some disadvantages. The biggest drawback is also the outcome of the combustion procedure.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
