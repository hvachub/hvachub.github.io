<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight.
