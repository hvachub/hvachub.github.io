<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection issues along the line that supplies power to your furnace can compromise the efficiency of the unit. Loose, malfunctioning or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the unit and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves inspecting the suggested connections along with temperature and pressure gauges. Take some time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>
