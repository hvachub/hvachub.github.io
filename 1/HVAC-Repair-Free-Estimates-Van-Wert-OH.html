A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
