<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable principles.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
