<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Jefferson City Missouri</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the visit. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them again.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Installation Cost in Jefferson City MO 65109</h3>
<p>Central air units are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
