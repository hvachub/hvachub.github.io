<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company at Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating system. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
