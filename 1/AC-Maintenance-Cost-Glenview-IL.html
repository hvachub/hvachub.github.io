<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate terrific but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized.
