<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outside system as close to your house as possible per my request.

For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
