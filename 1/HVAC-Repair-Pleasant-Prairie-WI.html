<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Pleasant Prairie Wisconsin</h3>
<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in most cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores.
