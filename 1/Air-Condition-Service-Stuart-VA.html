<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as important as a regular oil modification in your cars and truck.

In addition, a fresh, tidy filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends replacing your filter. Throughout high usage months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>

<p>My oldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one.
