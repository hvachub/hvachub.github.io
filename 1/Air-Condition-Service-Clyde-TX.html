If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably straightforward procedure. Setting up a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, pollen, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>

To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have an unfavorable effect on residents-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
