<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the see. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search validated WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
