<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the flooring. All wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the area is dry and unblocked.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete pieces, we advise utilizing our insulation boards. When utilized in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as a really effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you money. They shows the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of allowing heat to heat up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your floor tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
