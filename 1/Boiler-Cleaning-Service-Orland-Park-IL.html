<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that ideal temperature throughout the year.

Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it likewise uses down your AC system, which can cause costly repairs down the roadway.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level.
