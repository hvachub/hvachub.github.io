<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Installation in Marathon Florida</h3>
<p>If your air conditioner is more than eight years old, repair is probably not worth the expense, unless it's an easy problem like particles clogging the condenser unit or a worn fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to assess not just the condition of your existing devices, but likewise the ducts that deliver the cool air and the total quality of the insulation in your home. Improving those aspects may increase the effectiveness of the system as much or more than installing new machinery.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical consumption and 30% lower cooling costs than devices set up simply a few years ago.<p>
<p>A customized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c because both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the exact same air course. A standard air conditioning system transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil launches heat outside. However, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the exact same room, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really heated, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
