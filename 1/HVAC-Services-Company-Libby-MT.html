<h3>How Can Air Heat Pump Works at Libby MT?</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
