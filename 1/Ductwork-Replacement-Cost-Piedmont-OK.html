<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
