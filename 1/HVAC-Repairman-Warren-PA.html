Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
