Soil with positive heat transfer properties requires fewer pipelines to achieve the wanted underground heating & cooling effect, while those with decreased thermal conductivity will need more pipelines.<p>

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.
