Longtime Seattle house owners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>

That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off prior to it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In truth, the room can feel clammy and moist.<p>
