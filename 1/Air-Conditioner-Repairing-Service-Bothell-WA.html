<p>Unpredictable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals produced as gases from processes or products; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Heavy production industries employ a fairly small percentage of air conditioning specialists and other HVAC employees, but pay a few of the industry's greatest salaries. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 annually. Vehicle parts producers, aerospace manufacturers and vehicle producers are all within a few cents of each other at around $31 per hour, or over $64,000 per year.
