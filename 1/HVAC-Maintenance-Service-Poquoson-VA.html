<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Poquoson VA 23662</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>In addition, employee health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, irritation, and irregular breathing may be induced as the result of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow. Workplace temperatures need to be maintained between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by excessive air flow need to be avoided.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might discover musty or undesirable odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak to your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
