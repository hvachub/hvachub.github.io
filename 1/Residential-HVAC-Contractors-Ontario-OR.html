<p>Having a wood-burning heating system can be exceptionally efficient in regards to cost. If you have access to free or cheap fire wood, or you cut your own wood from your timber, it might not cost you anything at all. Regrettably, wood-burning heater need an extremely crucial natural resource: wood! Wood-burning heat systems may not be great for the environment despite being carbon neutral because of the amount of wood needed to properly heat your whole house.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely made the most of. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
