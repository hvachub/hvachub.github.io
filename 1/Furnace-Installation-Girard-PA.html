<p>My oldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think of anything else other than changing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The sound level is itâ and low $ s great on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will start to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without being available in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living rooms and cooking areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
