<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and huge houses. Numerous steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago remain operable, because the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to wear and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending on boiler size.<p>

<p>The technological improvements in heating devices have been enhancing year after year. Boilers and heating systems now use less fuel to provide heat and warm water, are much easier to maintain, and are also smaller sized and quieter.

While superior in numerous aspects, newer equipment still needs to be properly kept to provide continued, safe operation at peak efficiency.

<p>When your HVAC expert informs you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your vehicle. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Additionally, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. Energy Star suggests replacing your filter once every 3 months. Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
