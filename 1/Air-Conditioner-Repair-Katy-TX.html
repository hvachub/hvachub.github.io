The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room.

This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical material gradually.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
