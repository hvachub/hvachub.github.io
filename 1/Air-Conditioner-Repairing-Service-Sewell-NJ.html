<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
