<p>Many factors affect IAQ. These factors include poor ventilation (lack of outdoors air), issues managing temperature level, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can affect the fresh air coming into the building. Sometimes, particular contaminants like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals launched as a gas over time) may cause bad IAQ.<p>
