<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at optimal performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller sized home, which will impact installation costs. Also a home with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any fractures for air flow will need far less AC capacity to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other aspects that can impact this could be the insulation in other places such as the structure, roofing, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>The ability of natural chemicals to trigger health effects varies greatly, from those that are extremely toxic, to those without any recognized health impact.

At present, very little is understood about what health results occur from the levels of organics normally discovered in houses.
