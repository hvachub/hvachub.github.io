Makers generally continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard enters into impact.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical cooling service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or two. Loosen the old AC contactor before eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature and wait for the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor should run and the condenser fan ought to spin. If the compressor starts but the fan doesn't, the fan motor is probably shot. Shut down the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Lift the cover and eliminate the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Reinstall the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. , if it doesn't, you have actually provided it your finest shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
