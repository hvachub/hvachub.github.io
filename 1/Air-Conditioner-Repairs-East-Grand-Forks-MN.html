Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
