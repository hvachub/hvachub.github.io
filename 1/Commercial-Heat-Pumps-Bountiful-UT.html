<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building security at reasonable energy expenses. Load computing is referred to as the Manual J computation and should be carried out by the HVAC contractor before offering an installation or unit cost for cooling. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, determining the appropriate size of unit for your house also depends on the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Iâ $ m really picky with my stuff. I like my equipment and home appliances original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.
