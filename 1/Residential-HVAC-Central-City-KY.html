<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
