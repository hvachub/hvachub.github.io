<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service in Cape Coral FL</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is likewise necessary to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
