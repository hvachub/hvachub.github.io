<p>Some biological impurities trigger allergies, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some types of asthma. Infectious health problems, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins. Signs of illness caused by biological contaminants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, sleepiness, fever, and digestion issues.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the home.<p>
