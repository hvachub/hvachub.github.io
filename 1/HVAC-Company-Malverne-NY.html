Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces in Malverne NY</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
