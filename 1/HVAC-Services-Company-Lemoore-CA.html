<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Lemoore CA?</h3>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally efficient, due to the fact that ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a consistent temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent throughout the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heatpump have their geothermal effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance (COP). COP rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to develop the heating or cooling impact. Many ground source heat pumps have COPs of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every single system of energy utilized by a geothermal heatpump, approximately 3 to 5 systems are provided back in the form of heat.<p>
