<p>A health questionnaire need to be developed and distributed to all concerned employees. Such a tool must recognize the number of people impacted; define ages and task descriptions of involved employees; determine where they lie within the office; suggest when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health signs or diseases; determine all makers run in the office; show the type of outside air contamination; and determine prospective sources of job tension.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause pricey compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the abilities or tools required to examine refrigerant levels.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>

I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
