<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>Location the solar tank near the standard hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the tank, make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible.

If you are providing more than one service, you should separate these into various departments, as if they were their own separate service.<p>
<p>Because cooling and heating work might also require setting up or repairing plumbing to provide oil or gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might likewise be needed to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a licensed plumbing professional on call. However, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors particularly for this line of work. When getting a quote, make certain to ask not only if a company is certified, but also what type of license it holds.<p>
