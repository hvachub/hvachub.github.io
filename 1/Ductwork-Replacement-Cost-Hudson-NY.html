<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
