<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Central air conditioning is a luxury not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites must discover methods to combat the heat without a duct system.

Meanwhile, in huge box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are snatched up as quickly as they're stacked in floor displays. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the truth of a harsh, vicious summertime.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern-day, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and air conditioning designs, it may be better to replace the whole system.<p>
