<p>As with many house improvement tasks, the cost of a complete central heating system can differ commonly based on the size of the home. Most heaters will last between 15 and 20 years.

A small home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the home too rapidly and shut down for too long, resulting in irregular temperature levels.<p>

<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service several years ago and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
