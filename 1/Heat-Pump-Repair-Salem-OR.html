<h3>Things to Look for When Hiring an Salem OR HVAC Professional</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even small window package units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Lung Cancer - Lung cancer causes the largest number of deaths connected to asbestos exposure. People who operate in the mining, milling, production of asbestos, and those who utilize asbestos and its items are most likely to establish lung cancer than the basic population. The most common symptoms of lung cancer are coughing and a change in breathing. Other signs include shortness of breath, relentless chest discomforts, hoarseness, and anemia.<p>
