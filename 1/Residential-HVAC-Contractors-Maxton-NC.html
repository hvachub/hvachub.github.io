It might likewise include the installation of signs up where the ductwork links to specific areas.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
