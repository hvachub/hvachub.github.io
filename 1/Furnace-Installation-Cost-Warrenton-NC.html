<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not offer them..

Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly.
