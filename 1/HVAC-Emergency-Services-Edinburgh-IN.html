<p>Among the disadvantages of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to install, particularly in an older home. Depending on the type of unit installed, it can be loud and cause problems if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, specific fuels and devices might require special licenses, and there is restricted versatility in case of altered heating requirements. During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
