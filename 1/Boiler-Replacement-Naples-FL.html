<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location.
