<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Glen Cove NY</h3>

After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, determined particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
