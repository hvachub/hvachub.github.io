<p>As many of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory guarantees remain in location. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often tough to quantify, as one action mentioned the savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not just break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the outcome of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in holes and cracks. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the component.  an extremely useful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a client thousands.<p>
