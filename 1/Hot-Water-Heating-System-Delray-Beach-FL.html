<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, automobiles such as cars, trains, ships, submarines and airplanes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are controlled with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
