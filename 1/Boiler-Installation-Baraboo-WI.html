<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Contractor in Baraboo</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
