<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct.

When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the distribution system.<p>
