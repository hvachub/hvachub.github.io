<h3>Heating And Cooling Companies in Tustin CA 92780</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
