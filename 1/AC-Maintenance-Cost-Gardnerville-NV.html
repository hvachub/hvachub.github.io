For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Most credible HVAC technicians will provide totally free estimates with an in-person service call.
