<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<h3>HVAC Supply in Roseboro NC 28382</h3>
<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the growth of mold in moist air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also irritate your sinuses and lungs, while excessive indoor humidity can add to the growth of bacteria and infections, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>The toxins listed in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health results pointed out. Nevertheless, it is not always real that the results kept in mind happen at the pollutant concentration levels normally discovered in the house. In most cases, our understanding of the toxins and their health results is too minimal to determine the levels at which the listed effects could happen.<p>
<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals emitted as gases from items or procedures; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly innocuous as a brand-new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>The primary health impact connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
