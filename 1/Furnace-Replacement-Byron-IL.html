<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â A lot of furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and manage of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, however the new control board need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
