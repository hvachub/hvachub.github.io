If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from getting used to the right temperature. Heaters that kick on often might be due to an unclean filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>Just like most house improvement projects, the cost of a full central heating unit can differ extensively based on the size of the home. Many heating systems will last in between 15 and 20 years. In choosing a furnace, property owners must think about heat output and performance. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the house. A little house, for example, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace might heat the house too quickly and shut down for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature levels.<p>
