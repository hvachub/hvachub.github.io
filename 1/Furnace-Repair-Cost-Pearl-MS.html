<p>I am really amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years back and know the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the like geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the process by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical energy. The 2 operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be warmed to boiling point to attain its aims.<p>
