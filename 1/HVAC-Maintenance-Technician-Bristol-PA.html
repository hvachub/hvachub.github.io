CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>

<p>The most hazardous asbestos fibers are too little to be visible. After they are inhaled, they can accumulate and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can trigger lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and stomach linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these illness do not show up till several years after exposure began. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some industrialized illness from exposure to clothes and devices brought house from job sites.<p>

<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Bristol PA?</h3>
<p>Many people know that outdoor air contamination can impact their health, however indoor air pollution can likewise have substantial, hazardous effect. EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Board of advisers regularly rank indoor air contamination among the top five environmental health dangers to the public.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed wetness. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
