The air was cooled, and thus the amount of wetness in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the space manageable. The controlled temperature and humidity assisted preserve constant paper measurements and ink alignment.

That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
