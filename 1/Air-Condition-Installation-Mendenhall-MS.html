Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels sometimes used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need further cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold development and moisture inside your home is related to a higher frequency of occupant respiratory problems.<p>

<p>For every single load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go someplace. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a reliable and straightforward technique to reduce ambient air contamination and potential health dangers, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more tough to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity must be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
