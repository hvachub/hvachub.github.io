Initially, use exterior-grade pushed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider using solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that an efficient wetness barrier is installed prior to setting up the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not completely adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated.<p>

<p>Prior to cooling or installing any new heating system in a home, it is necessary to re evaluate and decrease the energy load of the house. A more energy effective house will not just decrease the cost of a new system and energy expenses, however it will greatly improve the comfort of your house.

Basic improvements typically consist of adding insulation and air sealing steps. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest a number of qualified house Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact Us for references.<p>
