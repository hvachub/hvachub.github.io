<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
