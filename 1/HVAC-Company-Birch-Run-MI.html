<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Understand in Birch Run MI</h3>
<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wooden flooring joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final floor surface. This is usually utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and makes the most of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber radiant floor heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
