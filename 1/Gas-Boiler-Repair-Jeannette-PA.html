<h3>Benefits of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces at Jeannette PA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and usage really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing.

No extra charge.<p>
