<h3>Air Conditioner Repair in Saint Augustine FL 32084</h3>

All of the most recent heating systems are a lot more energy-efficient than those installed even twenty years ago. So, while it may look like a short-term larger expenditure, a brand-new, more energy-efficient house heater will more than likely save you money in the longer-term by lowering your yearly energy costs.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square footage. They utilize a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the area, the more effective the home heating unit needs to be. For already built home heating systems, the contractor will need to eliminate the old furnace to include the brand-new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>
