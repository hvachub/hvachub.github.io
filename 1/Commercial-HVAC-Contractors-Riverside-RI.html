<p>Indoor contaminants. These include chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).

Gas cook tops must be used with fans that send exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of incomplete combustion.
