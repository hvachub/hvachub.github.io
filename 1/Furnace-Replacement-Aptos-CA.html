<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other kinds of heatpump, have actually effectiveness rated according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE. It's a scientific method of identifying how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. The majority of geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This indicates for every unit of energy utilized to power the system, 3 to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>
