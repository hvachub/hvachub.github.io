<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct work, providing warm air to private bedrooms, living spaces and cooking areas through the vents or registers.<p>
