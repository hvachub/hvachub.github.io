Buildings continuously progress as an outcome of the changes in the environment around them along with the residents, materials, and activities within them. The numerous surface areas and the air inside a building are continuously connecting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as altering somewhat with time as it becomes unclean, then is cleaned up, accumulates dirt again, is cleaned again, and so on through its life.

<p>A bioaerosol is an airborne item of a biological contaminant. Biological contaminants in the home may consist of mold, bacteria, viruses, mites, and pollen. Bioaerosols released into the air can be dispersed throughout the home by the HVAC system. Bioaerosols can trigger contagious illness such as Legionnaires' illness.
