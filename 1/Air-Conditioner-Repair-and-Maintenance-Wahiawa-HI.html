Sealing leakages in ductwork can improve HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler home in the hot summer.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to correctly service and the unit has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
