<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the significance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise pleased that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>Consider potential results of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the producer's instructions, particularly instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While an area heating unit remains in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window a little.<p>
