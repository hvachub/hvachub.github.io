<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
