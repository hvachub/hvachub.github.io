<p>Fantastic Product! Shipment was type of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we resolved problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their bathroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
