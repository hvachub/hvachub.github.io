<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Texas City TX</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to get rid of the old water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heater. We chose getting something more costly than a conventional water heater as gas is among our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
