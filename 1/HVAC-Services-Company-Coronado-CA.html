<p>Before you head out and buy an air conditioning system, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to install some or go ductless? How large should the a/c be? Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning system and reduce its life. Too little and your air conditioning unit will not be able to cool your house properly. These are simply a few of the elements that you need to take into consideration when buying a new AC system. Each choice can and will substantially affect your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce pollutants.) Nevertheless, measures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
