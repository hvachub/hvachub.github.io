<p>I usually don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
