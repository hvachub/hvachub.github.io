<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be residing in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a danger to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Customer Reports National Proving Ground. However a number of the important things individuals do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their houses and aggravate asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less effective. Central air systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last approximately twenty years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life-span, replacement may be the most economical service.<p>
