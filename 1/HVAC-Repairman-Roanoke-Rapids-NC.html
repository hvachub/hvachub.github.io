It sounds astounding, however furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

If your home is not heating up, just be concerned. However, if your system does not seem working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to employ a specialist to examine and repair the system.<p>
