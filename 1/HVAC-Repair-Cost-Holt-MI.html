<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing system, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next step is to defrost your air conditioning devices. The simplest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
