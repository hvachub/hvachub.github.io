According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's greatest typical wages for HVAC specialists at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest typical wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 per year.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) However, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which results in the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
