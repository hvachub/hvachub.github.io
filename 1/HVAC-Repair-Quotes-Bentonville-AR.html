If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off totally.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.)

<h3>Air And Heat Repair in Bentonville AR 72712</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC system. Unfortunately for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
