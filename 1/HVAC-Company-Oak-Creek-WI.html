After two years, things began to change. There have actually been awkward sounds. I got it examined and fixed. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Reliable on the whole. Cool operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its looks in the start. But then recognized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
