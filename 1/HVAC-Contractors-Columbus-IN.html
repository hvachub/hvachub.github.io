Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness. Unclean filters can cause additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
