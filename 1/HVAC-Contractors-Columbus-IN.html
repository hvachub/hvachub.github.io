Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with debris that can restrict air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's effectiveness.

As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
