<p>The world's leading all-in-one software application for commercial and residential HVAC businesses. HVAC service technicians are subject to a variety of potentially harmful conditions. Specialists are frequently needed to operate in cramped areas, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofing systems of homes. They can be exposed to undesirable weather for long periods of time. Since they are called to structures without working environment control, they are likewise subject to the extreme hot or cold temperatures existing inside a place.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too quickly, and your house will not heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. An unclean filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
