<p>Typically the most reliable method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then distribute these contaminants through the house.<p>
