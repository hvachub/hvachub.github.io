<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Leaking return ducts can likewise present moisture. Once again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
