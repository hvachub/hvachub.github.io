<p>They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for.

<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are generally just available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
