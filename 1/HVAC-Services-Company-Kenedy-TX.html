<p>All houses require efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible reason might be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a filthy burner.<p>
