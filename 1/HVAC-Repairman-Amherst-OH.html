However, much of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Allergens are products that trigger an immune-type reaction in people who are sensitized to these materials. Allergens found in indoor air are mainly biological product such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect bug particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these products are little particles, can become air-borne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Allergens that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can cause asthma attacks. For instance, if you think about a group of people with asthma, the presence of cat allergen could bring on an asthma attack in people with feline allergies, but not in those people who do not have cat allergic reactions.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, wall, ceiling, and floor coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours may become a source for mold growth and should be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in hidden or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, chances exist will be mold growing close by. Fix the wetness problem, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the area using recognized health department suggestions.<p>
