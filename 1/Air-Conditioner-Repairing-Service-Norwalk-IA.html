<p>Devices expenses are driven by the kind of furnace at the heart of your home heating unit. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, however lead to greater energy costs.

<p>Generally the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to remove specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
