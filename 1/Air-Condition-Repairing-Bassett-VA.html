<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%.

Simply put, the outside system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
