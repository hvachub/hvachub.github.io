<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Malone NY</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window plan systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>

Combs Heating & Cooling is totally licensed and guaranteed. All of our proficient contractors have updated HVAC licenses and are in compliance with local and state laws.
