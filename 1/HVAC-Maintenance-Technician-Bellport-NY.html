<p>Just like many house improvement projects, the cost of a complete central heater can vary extensively based on the size of the house. Many furnaces will last in between 15 and twenty years. In choosing a furnace, property owners should consider heat output and efficiency. Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace must be matched to the size of the house. A little home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the house too quickly and turn off for too long, leading to irregular temperature levels.<p>
