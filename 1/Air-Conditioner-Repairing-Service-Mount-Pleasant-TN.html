<p>The split system is the most typical. The majority of people are used to seeing this key in the yards of houses.

Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous spaces at the same time, however are not extremely energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house.

The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy requiring water be heated to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
