Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

Usually this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay.
