<h3>Heat Ventilation And Air Conditioning in Buxton ME 04093</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater incomes for air conditioning tradespersons. This may be due to high cost of living, remoteness, undesirable climate, or merely a high level of competition for knowledgeable trades. According to BLS figures, Alaska had the nation's highest average incomes for HVAC service technicians at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 annually. The District of Columbia ranked second, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 per year. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut completed the five highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 each year.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it pertains to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to appropriately cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
