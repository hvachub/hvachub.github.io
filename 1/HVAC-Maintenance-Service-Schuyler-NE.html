<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperature levels in Seattle are acceptably average, you can anticipate a minimum of 30 days during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees.
