The purpose of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to offer and preserve comfortable and healthy environments free of contaminants. An essential part of the program is reacting to and resolving issues of building residents about issues in their workplace.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are especially at danger. EPA estimates that direct exposure to secondhand smoke increases the variety of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke causes nose, throat, and eye inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some studies have actually linked exposure to previously owned smoke with the start of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
