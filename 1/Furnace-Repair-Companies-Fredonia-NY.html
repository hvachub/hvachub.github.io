<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Fredonia NY 14063</h3>
<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent task installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S repaired and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the issue and fixed very rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>This review is for changing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an exceptional job in making sure we comprehended the pros and cons of each choice. The specialists who set up the brand-new system were quick and professional, while taking time to make certain we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
