<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a typical approach of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will minimize but not remove direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that smoking produces such large quantities of toxins, natural or mechanical ventilation strategies do not eliminate them from the air in your house as quickly as they build up. In addition, the big boosts in ventilation it requires to significantly minimize exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs significantly. Consequently, the most efficient way to minimize direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking there.<p>
