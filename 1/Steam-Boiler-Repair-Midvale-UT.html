<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) describes air quality in indoor workplace, class or lab environments, rather than industrial or outside settings. In jobs where union membership is not an issue, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure.

<p>There are numerous actions a homeowner can require to choose items that will prevent indoor air issues from taking place - a number of them are mentioned here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floorings, kitchen cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an option, consider utilizing solid wood products. Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements, make sure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it becomes damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed.<p>
