<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Repair in Greenup KY 41144</h3>
<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise switches functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
