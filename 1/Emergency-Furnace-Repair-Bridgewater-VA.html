<p>The primary factor homeowners do not acquire an HVAC service agreement is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's guarantee, the cost may not be rewarding. Any significant repairs need to be covered under the producer's warranty. Nevertheless, some manufacturers require routine maintenance as a regard to the guarantee.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an important function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
