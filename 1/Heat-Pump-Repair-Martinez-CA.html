<p>A geothermal desuperheater is useful and really effective, especially during the Summer while the system acts to cool one's house.

Furthermore, throughout winter season, the heat from underground can be taken in to heat domestic water together with its primary function of providing space heating. This means that cost savings are still recognized during the chillier duration. In fact, a desuperheater minimizes winter water heating expenses by around half.<p>
