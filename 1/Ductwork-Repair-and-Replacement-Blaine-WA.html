<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other costs before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% normally isn't completion goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the same in all other locations.<p>
