<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that gain access to would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity specialist at a large merchant who asked not to be called because he did not have permission to speak on the record, it prevails for large retail operations to have a team that routinely keeps track of energy consumption and temperatures in shops to save on costs (especially during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperatures in the shops change outside of an appropriate range that could prevent customers from shopping at the shop.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to remove individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adapted to reduce the quantity of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient method to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this area.<p>
<p>Often a momentary indoor air quality issue is created simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting location.
