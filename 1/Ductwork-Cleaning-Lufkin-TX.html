The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 ought to be calibrated often, and outside measurements used for estimations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be essential.<p>
