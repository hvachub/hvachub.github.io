<p>Expert heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this basic rule when deciding whether it's worth buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>

If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement might be the most cost-efficient option.<p>
