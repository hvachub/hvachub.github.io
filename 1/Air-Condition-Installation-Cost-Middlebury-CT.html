<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
