<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well.

<p>The first a/c and fridges utilized hazardous or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly mishaps when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
