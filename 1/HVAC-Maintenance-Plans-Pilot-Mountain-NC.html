<h3>Have Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in Pilot Mountain NC</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the various homes they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condominiums, row housing, etc.). No matter what the kind of home HVAC system, sufficient air circulation (ventilation), proper filtering, and humidity control all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Also, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will ensure that it is operating securely and not adding to or causing an indoor air issue.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the entire surface area of a floor heats up the lower half of the room, covering inhabitants in heat at a lower general temperature-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a traditional heating system." In other words, in-floor heating systems provide a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness projects have long reminded us, the more comfortable we feel, the more likely we may be to push down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
