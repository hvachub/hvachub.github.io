<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might enter nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
