Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
