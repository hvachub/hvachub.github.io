<p>Some cooling systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
