<p>While toxins commonly found in indoor air are accountable for many damaging impacts, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are essential to produce particular illness. People also react very differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is needed to much better comprehend which health results take place after direct exposure to the typical pollutant concentrations discovered in homes and which take place from the higher concentrations that happen for short periods of time.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality problems. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in adequate outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
