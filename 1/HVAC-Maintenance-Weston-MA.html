<p>Right now, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be residing in your house's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a risk to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Customer Reports National Research Center. However many of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne impurities in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Fact: Federal and local incentives usually total up to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new building (houses typically utilize in between one and five loads). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the best conditions.<p>

<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold buildup, states Dr. Khatri.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often described as central air" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home.
