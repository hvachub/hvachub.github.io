This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
