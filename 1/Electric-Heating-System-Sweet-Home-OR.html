Not all heating systems are good for all homes, and there are a number of elements that absolutely need to be considered before choosing one.

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the within air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
