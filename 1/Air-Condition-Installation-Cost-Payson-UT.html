<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
