<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, considering that it is secured inside. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely.
