<p>Allergens are products that cause an immune-type response in people who are sensitized to these products. Irritants discovered in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, germs, and mold. All of these materials are small particles, can end up being airborne, and therefore, are quickly breathed in. Irritants that are inhaled by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

While a space heating system remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
