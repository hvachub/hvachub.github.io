<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They consist of delays in mental and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses, children, and babies are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the damaging impacts of lead. Children may have greater exposures given that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
