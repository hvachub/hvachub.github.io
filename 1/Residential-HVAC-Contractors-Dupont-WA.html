<p>Professional heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this fundamental rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new.
