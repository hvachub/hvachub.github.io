<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not basic, since it takes into consideration not just the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
<h3>HVAC Technician in Boxford Massachusetts</h3>
<p>If your a/c unit is more than 8 years of ages, repair is probably not worth the cost, unless it's an easy problem like debris obstructing the condenser unit or a used fan belt. Still, to finest weigh your repair-or-replace decision, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, however likewise the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your house.

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
