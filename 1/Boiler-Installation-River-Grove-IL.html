<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
