<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets requests for assessment and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. The likelihood of instant reactions to indoor air contaminants depends on several elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether a person responds to a toxin depends upon specific sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after repeated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>For instance, issues emerge when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in appropriate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation likewise takes place if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a way that outside air does not really reach the breathing zone of building residents. Improperly situated outside air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, ac system, or the inside surface areas of ventilation duct work.<p>

<p>Certain immediate impacts resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is frequently challenging to determine if the signs are a result of exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is essential to pay attention to the time and location the signs happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when an individual is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or normal household a/c unit does.
