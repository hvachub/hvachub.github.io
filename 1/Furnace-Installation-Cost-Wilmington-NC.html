<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to provide adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
