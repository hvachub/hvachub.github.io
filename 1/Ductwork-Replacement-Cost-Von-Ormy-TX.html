My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice up until you buy a replacement-- which you must do soon.<p>
