<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Person Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust.
