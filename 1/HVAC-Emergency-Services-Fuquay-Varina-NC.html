<p>A health survey should be developed and distributed to all worried workers. Such a tool should determine the number of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they are located within the office; suggest when the symptoms take place (time of day, day of week, and season); offer a list of particular health symptoms or illnesses; determine all devices operated in the work environment; suggest the kind of outside air pollution; and identify potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then determine the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those dimensions on hand when purchasing an air conditioning system to ensure it'll fit easily into the window. Also, keep fire safety in mind when deciding where to set up the air conditioning unit: Don't position it in an egress window that serves as the only ways of escape should a fire emerge.<p>
<p>If your single phase air conditioning system isn't old enough to justify replacement, consider an entire home dehumidifier. By setting up dehumidification equipment inside an existing single phase system, you can enjoy some of the advantages of a variable speed compressor without replacing any devices. The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfortable level, enhancing indoor air quality and enabling higher comfort at higher temperature levels.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners at least as soon as a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
