Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling.

<p>The condensate drain in your ac system and heatpump should be free of all blockages and debris. Clogs can block the flow of condensed water and cause moisture build-up within the system. Excess moisture can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the property, uneven temperature policy, germs, and compromised air quality.
