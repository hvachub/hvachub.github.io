<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in the house are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
