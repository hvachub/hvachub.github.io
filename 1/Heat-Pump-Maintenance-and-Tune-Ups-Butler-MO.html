All of the heat that radiant heat systems disperse moves through solid objects, keeping the heat near the flooring of the room where it is the most use. Radiant heat systems can also heat rooms with less energy spent, and keep them warmed for longer, because a lot of floors tend to maintain heat better than air does.<p>
