<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from use.

Heating systems that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the space.<p>
