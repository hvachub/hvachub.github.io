<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not provide auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There must not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
