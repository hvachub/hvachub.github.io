<p>I have actually been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and various issues that didn't make any sense.

He is honest, reliable, and affordable on cost. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
