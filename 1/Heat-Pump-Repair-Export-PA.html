<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that best temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters regularly, or get an a/c service plan which usually consists of a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>

But more complex issues-- recognized by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies below might be appropriate.<p>
