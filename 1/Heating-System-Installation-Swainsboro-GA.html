He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years ago and know the significance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will absolutely be utilizing Waycoff's once again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
