<p>Fantastic service within 24 hours and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was extremely extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out.

<p>The predominant health result related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
