<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
