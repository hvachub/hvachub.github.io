<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor in Coral Springs FL</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current trend in house building and construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
