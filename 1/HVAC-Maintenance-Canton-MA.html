Since they only partially remove the radon decay products and do not lessen the amount of radon getting in the home, the effectiveness of these devices is uncertain. EPA plans to do additional research study on whether air cleaners are, or might become, a reliable ways of decreasing the health threat from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers further details on air-cleaning devices to lower indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Incomplete combustion and bad ventilation of these devices (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor contaminants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems installed to eliminate products of incomplete combustion.
