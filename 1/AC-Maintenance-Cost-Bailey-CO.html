<p>I am a real estate investor, I need to replace two heating systems in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as constructing materials, furnishings and items like air fresheners, can launch contaminants more or less continually. Other sources, associated to activities like cigarette smoking, cleaning, refurnishing or doing hobblies release pollutants periodically. Malfunctioning or unvented home appliances or poorly utilized products can launch higher and in some cases hazardous levels of pollutants inside your home.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>

<p>The most unsafe asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can build up and stay in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be fatal). Symptoms of these illness do not show up until many years after direct exposure started. The majority of people with asbestos-related illness were exposed to elevated concentrations on the task; some industrialized disease from exposure to clothes and equipment brought house from task websites.<p>
