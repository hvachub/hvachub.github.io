<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
