<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, due to the fact that ground source heating is drawn out from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can obtain a geothermal performance of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can just attain an efficiency of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season. Similar to other kinds of heatpump, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates just how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending on whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to create the heating or cooling result. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this suggests is that for every unit of energy used by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the form of heat.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and after that change it ON.

You must hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
