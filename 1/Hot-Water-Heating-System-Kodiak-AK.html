<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ.

As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
