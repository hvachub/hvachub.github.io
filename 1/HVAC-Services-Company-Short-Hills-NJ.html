<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, paints, and pesticides used in the home.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

At lower levels of exposure, CO triggers moderate effects that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms consist of headaches, dizziness, disorientation, queasiness and fatigue. The results of CO direct exposure can vary considerably from person to person depending on age, total health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
