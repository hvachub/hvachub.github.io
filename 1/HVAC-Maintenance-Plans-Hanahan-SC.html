<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this chemical are ecological tobacco smoke, kept fuels and paint supplies, and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will lower benzene direct exposure consist of eliminating smoking within the home, providing for maximum ventilation throughout painting, and disposing of paint products and special fuels that will not be used immediately.<p>
<p>You might update to the greatest performance gear readily available and still not feel comfortably cool on hot days. That's due to the fact that the mechanicals are just part of the central air system. The typical house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your home, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or change your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining just how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have built-in hold-up features. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you have actually set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a homeowner does not have the skills or tools necessary to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
