<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the house. Pollutants might come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering your house from the ground below. An air toxin might likewise originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a defective furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, home cleaning, or individual care items. Bacteria and viruses, pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
