<h3>The Way to Avoid Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Coplay PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
