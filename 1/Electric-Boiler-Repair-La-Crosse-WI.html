<p>When the heatpump went out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>While contaminants typically discovered in indoor air are responsible for numerous damaging effects, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are required to produce particular illness. Individuals also respond very differently to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is required to much better understand which health impacts occur after direct exposure to the typical contaminant concentrations discovered in homes and which happen from the higher concentrations that happen for short time periods.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is often important to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can sometimes be obtained by asking for copies of air tracking information from the company. If monitoring data is not available, yet a high variety of health signs have actually been reported, the Union representative need to request that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information may identify potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
