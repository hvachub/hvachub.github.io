<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Brecksville OH?</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I understood what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Secondly like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
