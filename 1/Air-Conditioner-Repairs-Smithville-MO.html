<h3>Blocked Vents Repair in Smithville MO 64089</h3>
<p>The federal government suggests that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the quantity of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for recommended actions.) In addition, homeowners should be alert to the introduction of indications of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, wetness condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization steps should not be undertaken up until these problems have actually been remedied.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with badly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
