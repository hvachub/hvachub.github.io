We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating unit. We picked getting something more expensive than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
