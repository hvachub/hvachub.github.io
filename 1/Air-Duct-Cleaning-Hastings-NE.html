ProTex correctly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The set up group was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post install examination outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Carrier).<p>
