<p>Biological contaminants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transmitted by individuals and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne.
