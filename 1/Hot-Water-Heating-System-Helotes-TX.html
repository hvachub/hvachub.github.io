<p>If the AC does not switch off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't emit heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen over time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the issue, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
