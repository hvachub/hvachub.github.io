<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
