<p>Before you head out and buy an ac system, there are a few things to choose first. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your home is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the a/c unit be? Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system won't be able to cool your house appropriately. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't pay for to neglect any of them.<p>

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
