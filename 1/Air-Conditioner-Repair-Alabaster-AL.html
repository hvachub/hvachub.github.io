<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was very pleased they waited their work and repaired the issue. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>
<p>Another option to oil heating systems are gas heaters While oil is generally used in locations where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice between the two types. Gas furnaces cost about the very same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your home. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, instead of the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
