<p>Since it has to run longer than a correctly sized system, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the required wetness. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
