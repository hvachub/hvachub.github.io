<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely enjoyable person to work with. No pressure applied to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
