<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain poisonous substances (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to dangerous levels of mycotoxin by means of inhalation is not possible in many cases, as contaminants are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the launched spores. The primary risk of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall. More severe than a lot of allergenic properties is the capability of mold to trigger episodes personallies that already have asthma, a serious respiratory disease.<p>

Air-side economizers also use outdoors air to condition areas, however do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outdoor air when proper.<p>
