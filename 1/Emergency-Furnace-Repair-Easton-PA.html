<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and completing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. Do not accept them up until they have actually been effectively dried if dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you choose them up. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
