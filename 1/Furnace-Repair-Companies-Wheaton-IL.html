<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high usage months, check the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
