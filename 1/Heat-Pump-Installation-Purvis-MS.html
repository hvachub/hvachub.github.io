<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated up by radiators are vulnerable to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot beside the radiators. This typically results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to warm up the house escape out of the window. Radiant heat offers heat from the flooring up throughout the room without any cold areas or stuffiness in the location being heated.<p>

With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal elements also. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple rooms simultaneously, but are not really energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house.
