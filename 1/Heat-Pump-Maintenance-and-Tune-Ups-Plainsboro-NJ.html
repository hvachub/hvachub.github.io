<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, however a property owner does not have the abilities or tools required to check refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the essential devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still required to have a specialist technician examine the system periodically.<p>

<p>Second, identification of impurity sources is often vital to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can sometimes be obtained by requesting copies of air tracking data from the employer. If monitoring information is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information might determine potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping track of information may not explain the observed or reported health signs.<p>
