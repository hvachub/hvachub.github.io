Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the minimized air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
