<p>Although commercial geothermal systems have remained in existence given that the mid-90s, and the concept developed much earlier than that, its application in houses is still relatively new. That implies there are less expert installers than with standard systems, and less competitors implies higher prices. In general, because it is still not extensively adopted, it can also be a challenge to discover skilled installers at your place.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system does not create its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as oil, coal, or gas. Instead, it takes in heat from within the earth.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my alternatives. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
