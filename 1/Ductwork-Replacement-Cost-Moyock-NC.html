<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Additionally, the company utilized 98% of the existing material bought with the house. This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and pipes. Throughout the evaluation on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace claiming health risk reason and contractor laws for their choice. As a brand-new homeowner I have actually found out how to identify the honest HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
