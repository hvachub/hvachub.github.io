<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference in the future). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
