<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
