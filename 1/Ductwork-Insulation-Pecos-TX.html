<p>As kept in mind, inappropriate temperature level and humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow might likewise add to employee health complaints. Temperature levels should vary from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels in between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts caused by excessive air flow need to be prevented. Maintenance of proper temperatures and humidity levels and appropriate air circulation will help to minimize the occurrence of upper respiratory symptoms, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>It may feel comfortable being sealed in tight against the cold in your house during the chillier months of the year, but for people who are delicate to indoor irritants or have respiratory problems, winter season can worsen issues. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing allergen, animal dander, and mold spores flowing through your home. In late winter season and early spring, it might still be too cold to throw open the windows to pull out the musty air, so while you await the warmer weather it's important to be aware of a few of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be hiding in your environments.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to supply threshold signals. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring devices to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to fix the situation right away.<p>
<p>The primary health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
