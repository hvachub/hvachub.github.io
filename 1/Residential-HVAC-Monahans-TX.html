<h3>Repair and Maintenance for Monahans TX Commercial Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like material, and should be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, really filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
