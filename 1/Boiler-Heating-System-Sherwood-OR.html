<p>Heat pumps are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that a lot of Seattleites will only use moderately, however since heat pumps can offer both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds!

<p>The split system is the most common. The majority of people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes.

<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for.

When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if entirely iced over.<p>
