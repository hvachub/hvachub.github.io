<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner at Tomah WI</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to decrease air leakage through cracks and other openings in walls, roofs, and floors. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor impurities and helps tire them from the home.<p>

Lower concentrations can cause a series of symptoms from headaches, d izziness, weak point, confusion, nausea, and disorientation, to tiredness in healthy individuals and episodes of increased chest discomfort in people with persistent heart problem. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often puzzled with the flu or food poisoning.
