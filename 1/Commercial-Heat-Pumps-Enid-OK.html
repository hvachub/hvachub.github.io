<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Enid OK</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
