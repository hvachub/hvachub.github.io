<p>I have been using them for years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various prices and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he advised me to contact guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he assisted me difficulty shoot the concern. He is sincere, reputable, and affordable on cost. It's difficult to discover an honest AC person and I'm delighted I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very helpful in collecting details on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to momentarily manage the problem and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and home.<p>

<p>As much of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Additionally, the concrete outcomes of a PM is often hard to measure, as one reaction mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the breeze of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repetitive use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, causing cracks and holes. If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a really advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
