<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace service technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
