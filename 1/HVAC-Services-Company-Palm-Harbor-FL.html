<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Palm Harbor FL</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioner before you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>

<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the issues which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He helped me problem shoot the issue when I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is sincere, dependable, and affordable on rate. It's hard to discover a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
