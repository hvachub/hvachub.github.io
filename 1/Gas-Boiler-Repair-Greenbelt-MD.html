<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Individuals working in structures with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.
