However, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'trustworthy' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the exact same).

For instance, a heat exchanger might fail too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing premature wear and tear, leading to holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. an extremely helpful result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
