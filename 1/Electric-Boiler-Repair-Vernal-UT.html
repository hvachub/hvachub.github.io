<h3>The Way to Find Quality Gas Furnace Reviews in Vernal UT</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
