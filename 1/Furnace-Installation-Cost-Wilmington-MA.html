<h3>Heating Duct in Wilmington MA 01887</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in excellent shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. Gradually, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors altered to prevent further damage to your system.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
