<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>These people have been excellent. At a realtor, I sometimes require contractors to give me a viewpoint for what work on a house may cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these guys twice. They came out quickly and provided me a no nonsense estimate for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Speak with you quickly.<p>
