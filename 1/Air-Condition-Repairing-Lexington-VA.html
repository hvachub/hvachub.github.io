<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Choosing the Ideal Lexington VA Company For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>There's a huge distinction between the heat transfer of radiation and the other common kind of house heating-- convection. Over the previous century, most of homes in colder climates were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the spaces for the warm air to keep the floorings, ceilings and walls warmed. In turn, the items in the space, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
