Start by opening the heat registers and after that move on to inspecting the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or check the service door cover.

<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary wetness. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
