<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with a basic repair he did on-site, not replacing the whole part. He got along, simple and a thoroughly enjoyable individual to have around that whole time. His time and proficiency to FIX the issue cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a rather uncertain diagnostic.<p>

The couple of times we require them for emergencies they responded quickly and solved the problem.<p>
