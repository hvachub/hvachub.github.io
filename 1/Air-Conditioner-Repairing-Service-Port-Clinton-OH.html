<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, smoke, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building and construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
