<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it simply takes more electricity to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts down before it has a chance to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In truth, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
