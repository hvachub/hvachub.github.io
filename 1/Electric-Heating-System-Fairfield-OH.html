<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Fairfield OH 45014</h3>
<p>Among the downsides of central heating is that it's possibly pricey to set up, especially in an older house. Depending upon the type of system installed, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're highly allergic to dust.

During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being transferred from the heating system to the living space.<p>
<p>In addition, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", meaning that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and extremely hot next to the radiators. This generally leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window.
