<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to lower the quantity of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions should also be required to decrease pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, residents need to look out to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures should not be undertaken till these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one aspect (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>
