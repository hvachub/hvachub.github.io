<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
