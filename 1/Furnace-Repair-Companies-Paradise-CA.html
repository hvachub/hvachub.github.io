<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>

<p>A hydronic glowing floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the floor or right within the floor surface area itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface of a flooring heats the lower half of the space, covering occupants in heat at a lower overall temperature level-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating unit." To put it simply, in-floor heating unit offer a different mode and level of comfort. And, as various public awareness campaigns have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we may be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenses.<p>
