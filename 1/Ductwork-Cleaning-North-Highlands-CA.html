<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned routinely, they can end up being obstructed with debris that can limit air flow, possibly affecting your comfort and your system's performance. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, replacing a furnace and checking filter can generally be performed in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>I have been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps people working. When a sales male concerns your home he exists to offer, that is the only way he is paid. You have a good Tech PM your system, he is paying costs and should not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were offered on.
