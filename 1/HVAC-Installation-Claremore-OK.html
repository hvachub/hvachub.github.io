<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find an area that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Because it exhausts warm air out the top, do not put the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any air flow limitation will decrease the unit's effectiveness. You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily circulate around it.<p>
<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be brought on as the outcome of temperature extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too little or too much air circulation. Work environment temperatures need to be maintained in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%.
