<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>If you have a large home, a house with high ceilings, a house with lots of windows or a home with insufficient insulation, heating your floors rather than the air may not suffice to reach the level of convenience to which you are accustomed.
