Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J computation and should be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square footage alone. As with determining the size of an unit required based on BTUs, figuring out the right size of unit for your house likewise depends on the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air unit is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy efficient than designs made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to replace or upgrade your system if it's five years of ages or older. The best central air conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while providing the same quantity of cooling.<p>
