<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are as different as the different homes they serve (single household homes, duplexes, mobile houses, houses, high-rise condominiums, row real estate, and so on). No matter what the kind of house HVAC system, sufficient air flow (ventilation), appropriate purification, and humidity manage all contribute to a healthy indoor air environment. > Likewise, regular maintenance of the HVAC system will make sure that it is running safely and not adding to or triggering an indoor air problem.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term due to the fact that of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as conventional air-source systems.
