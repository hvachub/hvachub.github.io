<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve cash over the long term due to the fact that of the lower energy costs. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as conventional air-source systems.
