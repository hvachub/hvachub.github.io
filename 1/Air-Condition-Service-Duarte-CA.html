<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
