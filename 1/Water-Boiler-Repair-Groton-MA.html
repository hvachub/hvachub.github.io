The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system.

The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units run separately from each other.<p>
