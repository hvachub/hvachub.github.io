<p>A packaged system, normally set up on the roofing, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is likewise a choice for house owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those aiming to save cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, considering that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capability.
