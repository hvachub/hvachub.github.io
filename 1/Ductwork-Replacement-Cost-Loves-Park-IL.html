<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, changing is probably a much better option.

<p>I called Snowflake Air because my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working properly. He had to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
