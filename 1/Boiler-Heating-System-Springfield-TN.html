<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to decrease the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, actions must also be taken to reduce pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners must look out to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization procedures ought to not be undertaken until these problems have been fixed.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those dimensions on hand when purchasing an air conditioning system to guarantee it'll fit easily into the window. Likewise, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to set up the a/c: Do not put it in an egress window that acts as the only means of escape should a fire emerge.<p>
