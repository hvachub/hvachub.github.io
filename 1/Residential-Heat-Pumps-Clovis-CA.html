<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside.
