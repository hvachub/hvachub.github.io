Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
