<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some heaters, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the concern isnâ $ t properly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable when installed.
