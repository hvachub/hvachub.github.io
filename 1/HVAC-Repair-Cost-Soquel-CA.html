<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary air conditioning unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the a/c need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
