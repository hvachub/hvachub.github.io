EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Gadgets, supplies further information on air-cleaning gadgets to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander.
