<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Dillon MT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
