<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Gloucester VA 23061</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil.

The easiest method to thaw your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a couple of hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
