<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical substances. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, flooring and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas stoves can cause levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
