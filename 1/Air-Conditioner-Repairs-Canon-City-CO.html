Running on electrical power, a heat pump is an economical service using a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your refrigerator, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air already inside your house, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your house.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, along with all other types of heatpump, have actually effectiveness ranked according to their coefficient of efficiency, or POLICE. It's a clinical method of identifying how much energy the system moves versus just how much it utilizes. Many geothermal heat pump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0.

<p>Many people undervalue the level of the indoor air contamination issue. Air contamination is typically pictured as the black smoke given off from factories.

<p>Radiant heat includes installing coils or pipelines in the floor, providing heat from below and moving up. It provides an even, overall heat temperature throughout the space. Without any moving parts, it's really quiet and comfy, and it doesn't stir up as much dust and irritants, as compared to forced-air systems. It also does not produce any drafts, and removing the requirement to blow air makes it more energy efficient.<p>
