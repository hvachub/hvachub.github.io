<h3>Home Furnace in Davis California</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the check out. They advised changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part.
