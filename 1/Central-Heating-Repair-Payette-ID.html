Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work.

Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
