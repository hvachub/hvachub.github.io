An oversize compressor also costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And an oversize system does not lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and wet.<p>
