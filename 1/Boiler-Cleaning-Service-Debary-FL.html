<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices usually lasts years, because it is safeguarded indoors. When it does need to be changed, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground in time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.
