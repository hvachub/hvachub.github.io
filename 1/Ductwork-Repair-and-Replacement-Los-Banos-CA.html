<p>A geothermal heating unit is more reliable than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but instead takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and readily available source of energy.<p>
