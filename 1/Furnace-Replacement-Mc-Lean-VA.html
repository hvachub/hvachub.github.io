<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too quickly, and your house won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter.

All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental house. When I called and he recommended me to call guarantee which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the concern.
