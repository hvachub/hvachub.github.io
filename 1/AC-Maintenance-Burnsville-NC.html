After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In some cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Lots of factors impact IAQ. These aspects consist of poor ventilation (absence of outside air), problems controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current improvement, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering the building. In some cases, specific pollutants like dust from building or restoration, mold, cleaning supplies, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of small amounts of chemicals launched as a gas in time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
