<h3>Recognizing the Significance of HVAC Systems in Liberty MO</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Responsibility 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they needed to get rid of the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more costly than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
