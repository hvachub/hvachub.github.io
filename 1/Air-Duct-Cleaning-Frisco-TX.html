<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils ensures dirt doesn't build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies show that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to decrease your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them till they have actually been correctly dried.
