The Efficiency Check-Up (see previous answer above) is also crucial to your furnace's life expectancy.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally discovered someone to properly service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
