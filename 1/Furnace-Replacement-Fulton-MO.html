<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in each month, it aids with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this helps.<p>
