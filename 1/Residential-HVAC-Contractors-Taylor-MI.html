<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
