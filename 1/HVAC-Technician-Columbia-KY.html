<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, class or lab environments, rather than outside or commercial settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that disperses the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, connecting the ducts to the HVAC system, and installing the ductwork in the structure. It might also consist of the installation of signs up where the ductwork connects to private spaces.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned regularly, they can end up being clogged with debris that can limit air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's performance. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more extreme cases cause the system to shut down totally. By contrast, replacing a furnace and examining filter can typically be carried out in just a couple of minutes, often without any tools required. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have very high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
