<h3>How to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing at Nuevo CA</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) contacted us through the CPW program to bid on different house effectiveness upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took ample time to assist us discuss which upgrades were cost efficient, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the largest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's items and services was outstanding. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a sensible level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the needed electrical improvements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
