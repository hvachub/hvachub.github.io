<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have actually performances ranked according to their coefficient of performance, or COP.
