<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The probability of instant reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon a number of factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual responds to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which varies tremendously from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for financial liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should pursue 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the same in all other areas.<p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also want to refresh your market analysis to get some strong indications of the customer interest and competitors in those areas. Before sitting down to write the product and services part of a business plan for an HVAC company, you'll wish to get up to speed on some of the latest trends, from ductless heating and cooling systems to HVAC systems that use renewable resource sources.<p>
