<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
