The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my good friends.<p>

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
