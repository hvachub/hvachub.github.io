<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, workers attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>
