<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very practical in gathering information on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily cope with the problem and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear communication about the issue, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
