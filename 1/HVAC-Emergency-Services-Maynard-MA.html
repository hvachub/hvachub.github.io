<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to big industrial and office buildings such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, ships, submarines and planes, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are managed with regard to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material gradually. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
