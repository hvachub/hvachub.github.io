<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI affirmed before the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most current science for NO2.

<p>This is especially notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with poorly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
