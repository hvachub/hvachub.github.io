<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product gradually.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
