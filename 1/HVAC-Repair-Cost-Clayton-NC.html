<p>All homes need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from usage.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
