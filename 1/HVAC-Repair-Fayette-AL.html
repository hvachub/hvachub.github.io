<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have a problem as long as your house still warms to the right temperature level. The temperature of the air produced by the heatpump will not always be as hot as the air produced by a furnace so it might not feel extremely hot. Only be worried if your house is not heating up. Nevertheless, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you need to hire a specialist to inspect and repair the system.<p>
