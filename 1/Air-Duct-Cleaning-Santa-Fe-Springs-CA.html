<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
