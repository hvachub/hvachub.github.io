<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, often described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>
