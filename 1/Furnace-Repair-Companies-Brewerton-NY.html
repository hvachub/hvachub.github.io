Air pressure differences produced by these forces move air-borne toxins from areas of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any offered opening in building walls, ceilings, floorings, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is small, air will move until the inside pressure amounts to the outside.<p>
<p>A geothermal heating system is more trustworthy than alternatives, and is not affected by any external factors, unlike other renewable resources such as wind energy and solar power. For example, wind energy can only be used when there is wind, while solar power counts on routine sunshine to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a reliable and available source of energy.<p>
