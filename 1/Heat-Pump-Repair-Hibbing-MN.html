<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
