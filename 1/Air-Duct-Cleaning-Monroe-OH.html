<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Monroe OH?</h3>
<p>Most residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The present trend in house building is to reduce air leakage through cracks and other openings in roofs, floorings, and walls. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much greater. This fresh cosmetics air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
