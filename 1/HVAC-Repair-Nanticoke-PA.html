<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they must be positioned. Most commonly they are mounted at height-level or slightly lower, if people mainly stay seated in that particular area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're trying to track you'll need to place the sensor accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>

<p>I am extremely satisfied with this company. One of my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service many years ago and understand the value of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
