Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the water heater since the professionals thought they simply didn't appear ideal and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>
