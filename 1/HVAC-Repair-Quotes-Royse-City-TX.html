<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both within and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs.
