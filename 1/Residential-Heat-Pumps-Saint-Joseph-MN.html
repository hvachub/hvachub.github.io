<p>Chemical toxins: Unstable natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They include both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical toxins can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; flooring, wall and furnishings coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
