<h3>Heating Systems in East Weymouth MA 02189</h3>
<p>The residential or commercial properties and composition of the soil in a location can impact the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These need to be considered prior to picking the best design of an underground heating and cooling system. Soil with positive heat transfer homes needs less pipes to achieve the desired underground heating and cooling effect, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will need more pipes.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
