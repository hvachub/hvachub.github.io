<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a correctly sized system. An oversize compressor also costs more to run because it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the space can feel clammy and moist.<p>
