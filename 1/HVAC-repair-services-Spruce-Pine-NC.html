<p>Prior to you head out and purchase an air conditioner, there are a couple of things to choose first. Where are you going to be installing the air conditioning unit? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How large should the ac system be? Too big and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning unit and reduce its life. Too small and your air conditioning system will not have the ability to cool the house correctly. These are just a few of the aspects that you require to consider when shopping for a new AC system.

<p>To put this merely, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO preserve the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor carefully, a number of the 'reputable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed house owners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
