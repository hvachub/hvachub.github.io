<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the air conditioning unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set package in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storeroom has a concrete floor, location two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too quickly, and your home won't heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
