<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer car debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to offer car debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
