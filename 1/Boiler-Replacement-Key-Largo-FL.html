<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensing Units: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface ignitor) or electronic lighter goes bad, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it shuts down rapidly. This is a really typical repair.

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Key Largo FL</h3>
<p>First, unlike central air conditioning, you have a couple of options when it pertains to central heater. We'll delve into costs later on, but you can select from a furnace, boiler or heat  pump. In general, heaters are the most inexpensive choice. However, your option will mainly boil down to what your ducts allow or what was previously in your home. Ask your heating contractor for the most suitable choice.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is typically an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
