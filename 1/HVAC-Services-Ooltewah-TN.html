People also react really in a different way to exposure to indoor air contaminants. Additional research is needed to much better understand which health impacts occur after exposure to the typical toxin concentrations found in homes and which occurs from the higher concentrations that occur for short periods of time.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, minimizing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The product was very lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we solved concerns. I would advise this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.
