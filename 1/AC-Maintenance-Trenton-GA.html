<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of sensible ones received. Others were almost two times the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Provider. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up examination outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>

Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to properly service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
