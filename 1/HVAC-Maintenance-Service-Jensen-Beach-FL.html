Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot.

For instance, wind energy can only be utilized when there is wind, while solar energy relies on regular sunlight to work efficiently. Geothermal heating depends on neither the wind nor the sun, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is constantly hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and readily available source of energy.<p>
