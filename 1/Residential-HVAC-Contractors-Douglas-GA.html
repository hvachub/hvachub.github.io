<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use.

Heaters that kick on frequently may be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal concern. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. However, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
