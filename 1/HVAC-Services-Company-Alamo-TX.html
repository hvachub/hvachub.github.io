<p>Sean was very practical. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>

In turn, the things in the space, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
