<h3>Boiler Installation in Peachtree City GA 30269</h3>
<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so deal with your contractor to discover an area that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Because it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or totally enclose it. Any airflow constraint will decrease the unit's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely distribute around it.<p>
<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
