<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers into Residential Boilers in New Caney TX</h3>
<p>I was very happy in the beginning because things ran efficiently with no noise. Moreover, I saw obvious modifications in my electrical energy bills. After 2 years, things began to alter. There have been awkward sounds. I got it repaired and examined. I am hoping that is the end of the problem. Overall, it has actually been a great experience. Reputable on the whole. Neat operation and very good cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start. However then realized A/cs are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
