<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
