<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, really dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
