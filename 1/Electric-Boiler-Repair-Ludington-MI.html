These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions require. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
