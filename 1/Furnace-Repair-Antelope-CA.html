<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
