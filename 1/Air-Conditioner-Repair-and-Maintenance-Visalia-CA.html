<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
