<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to buy it. My partner stated that she had actually seen a terrific review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and explained the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent individuals I have met in a long period of time. If we want to have alternatives to ACME heating, we need to support the real people who are there for us. Please do.<p>

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
