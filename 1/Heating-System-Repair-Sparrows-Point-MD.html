<p>An indoor air contaminant is a substance in the air that may impact the health of people who live in the home. Toxins could come from outside the house-- such as an idling vehicle engine in an attached garage, backyard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground below. An air toxin could likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or wet carpeting, or chemicals from pastimes, family cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and germs, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air toxins.<p>
