<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, considering that it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
