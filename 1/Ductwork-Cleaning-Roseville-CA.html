<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately.

<p>It is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists if no contaminant sources are found. Extreme re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stagnant air has greater levels of co2 and carbon monoxide (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. When ventilation is not sufficient to account for a boost in the number of workers in the area, stale air might likewise be a problem.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heating unit. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heating systems the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very crucial to maintaining a proper temperature.<p>

<h3>Forced Air Electric Furnace Repair and Maintenance in Roseville CA</h3>
