<h3>Steam Boiler Repair in South Richmond Hill New York</h3>
<p>Typically, an AC evaporator coil replacement costs $675 to $1,300. The evaporator coil is most likely frozen if your AC unit is wintry. Also, if the air conditioner smells bad, there might be bacteria accumulation on the coil. The cold liquid (refrigerant) inside the coil soaks up the heat far from your house. It will take from 2-4 hours for an HVAC technician to change the a/c unit's evaporator coil.<p>
<p>Because these activities create large amounts of lead dust, people have actually been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint. Consult your state health or real estate department for suggestions on which public firms or private laboratories might have the ability to help evaluate your home for lead in paint. Home test kits can not find small amounts of lead under some conditions. Employ an individual with unique training for correcting lead paint problems to remove lead-based paint.
