<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

<h3>Heat Ventilation in El Sobrante CA 94803</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>

Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
