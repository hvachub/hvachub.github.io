Because the excess heat taken in from within the house is conducted into the hot water tank rather than being transferred back into the earth, this is. The result, therefore, is free warm water!

The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Stopped up rain gutters can lead to water permeating into your house, leading to mold growth, according to the EPA. Yes, mold can grow essentially anywhere if the conditions are right, including on top of your house. Direct exposure to high levels of household mold may activate mold allergic reaction symptoms. Next time it rains, check your rain gutters. If you see water dripping out of end caps, flowing on the outdoors, or leaking behind them, it's time to go out the ladder.<p>
