For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost.
