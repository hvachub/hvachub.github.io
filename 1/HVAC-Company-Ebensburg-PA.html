<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
