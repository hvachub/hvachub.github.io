Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
