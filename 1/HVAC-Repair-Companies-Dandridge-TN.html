<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 need to be calibrated often, and outside measurements utilized for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it concerns central air costs, is the AC system's size.
