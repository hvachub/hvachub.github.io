<p>A routine furnace tune up can go a long method towards decreasing much of the concerns caused by build-up of dirt and particles, and the evaluations enable your contractor to keep an eye on longer-term problems and take proactive actions to help prevent premature failure or bothersome breakdowns during the heating season. Annual furnace service might also be a requirement to keep your furnace guarantee valid as well. Lots of producers state on guarantee documentation that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC provider are a part of the guarantee conditions.
