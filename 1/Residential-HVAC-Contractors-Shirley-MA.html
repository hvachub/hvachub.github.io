<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ might notice musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, talk to your physician about them. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out fixing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose explained the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
