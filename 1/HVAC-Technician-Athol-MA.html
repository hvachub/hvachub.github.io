<h3>How to Limit the Prices of Air Conditioner Repair at Athol MA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and fast about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in Athol MA 01331</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have actually heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
