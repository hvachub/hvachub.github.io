<p>Today's house convected heat systems maximize infrared radiation. By far, the most typical source of a radiator in a house is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally situated in one area like a restroom flooring or be set up across the entire sub-surface of the house's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are usually utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
