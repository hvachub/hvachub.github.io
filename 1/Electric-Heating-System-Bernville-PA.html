<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still extensively used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
