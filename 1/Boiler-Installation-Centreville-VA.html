<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
