<p>Moisture management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal convenience indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors produces the need for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors.

However, when pollutant concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on information may not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
