<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential buildings has become an essential concern to property owners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution research studies have identified a number of contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

Proper ventilation and removal of the sources of these impurities are important in preserving good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be serious. They consist of delays in psychological and physical advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, children, and babies are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups since lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures given that they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
