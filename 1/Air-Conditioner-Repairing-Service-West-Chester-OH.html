<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage present to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or so.
