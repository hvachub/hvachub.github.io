The air quality within and around structures and structures has a big result on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, nausea-- right away, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Epa (EPA).

A small home, for instance, may not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too quickly and shut off for too long, resulting in inconsistent temperature level levels.<p>
