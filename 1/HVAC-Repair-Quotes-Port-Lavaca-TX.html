<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for consultation and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on specific sensitivity, which differs greatly from person to individual. Some individuals can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after duplicated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as merely radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically linked to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
