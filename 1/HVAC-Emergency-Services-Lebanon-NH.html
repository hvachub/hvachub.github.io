<p>The function of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to generate appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and building safety at affordable energy costs. Load calculating is described as the Manual J calculation and need to be carried out by the HVAC contractor prior to providing an installation or unit cost for air conditioning. If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning system you require based on experience or on square video footage alone, relocate to another contractor. Similar to measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, identifying the appropriate size of system for your house likewise depends upon the unit load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>A split air conditioning system includes 2 main parts - a compressor located outside and a within air outlet system.
