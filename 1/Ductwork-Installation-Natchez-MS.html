<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, just including refrigerant is not an option. An experienced technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and performance of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>

<h3>What Exactly Are Inverted Heat Pumps in Natchez MS?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
