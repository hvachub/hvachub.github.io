<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
