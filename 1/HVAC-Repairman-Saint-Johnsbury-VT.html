<p>A/c can likewise be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its effectiveness.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be set up to offer threshold signals. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring equipment to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to deal with the scenario immediately.<p>
