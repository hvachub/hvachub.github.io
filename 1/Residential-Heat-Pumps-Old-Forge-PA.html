<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have very little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
