<p>I typically don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
