<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your automobile. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps pollutants and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. Throughout high use months, check the filters at least monthly.<p>
