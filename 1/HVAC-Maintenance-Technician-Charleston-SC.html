<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
