These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating during a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>

No additional charge.<p>
