For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry family pets, will require to have the filters changed more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation.

No additional charge.<p>
