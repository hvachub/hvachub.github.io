<h3>HVAC Emergency Services in Willard Ohio</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, however to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Another alternative to oil heating systems are gas furnaces While oil is traditionally utilized in areas where gas lines do not run, there are times when you may have a choice in between the two types. Gas heating systems cost about the same, roughly $6,000 for a high-efficiency system. The real advantage of using a gas furnace is the lower cost of heating your house. Heating with gas costs around $540 a year, rather than the $1,400 a year that it costs to heat with oil.<p>
