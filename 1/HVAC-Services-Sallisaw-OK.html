<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of money can be found in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
