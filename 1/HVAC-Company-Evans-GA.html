<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for assessment and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon several elements consisting of age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person reacts to a contaminant depends on specific level of sensitivity, which differs significantly from individual to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heatpump, everything needs to be replaced eventually. As devices ages, it ends up being less effective.
