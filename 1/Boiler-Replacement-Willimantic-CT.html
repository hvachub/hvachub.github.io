According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, in some cases the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>If you operate in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby includes lead, you might unwittingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothing.

Soil by roadways and highways might be infected from years of exhaust fumes from vehicles and trucks that utilized leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet before entering the house. If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, change your clothing before you go home and clean these clothing individually. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy areas rather of dirt which sticks to fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from consuming dirt, and ensure they clean their hands when they come within.<p>
