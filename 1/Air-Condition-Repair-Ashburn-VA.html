<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
