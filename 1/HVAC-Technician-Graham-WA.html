<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
