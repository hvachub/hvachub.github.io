<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just crazy and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
