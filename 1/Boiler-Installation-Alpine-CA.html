What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
