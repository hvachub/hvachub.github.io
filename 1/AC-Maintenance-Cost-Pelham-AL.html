<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
