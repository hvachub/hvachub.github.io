<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The very same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home.

It also prevents water from accumulating on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
<p>For example, problems arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in adequate quantities of outdoor air.
