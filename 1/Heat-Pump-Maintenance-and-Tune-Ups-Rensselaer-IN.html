<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Rensselaer IN</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The existing pattern in house building is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofings, walls, and floorings. The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air waters down indoor contaminants and helps tire them from the house.<p>
