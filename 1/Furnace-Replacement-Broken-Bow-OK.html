<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in collecting info on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily manage the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day.

<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also may add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may become clogged up, lowering air flow quality, circulation, and volume. They also may become places for molds and bacteria to be and grow dispersed throughout the house. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise should be appropriately maintained to avoid bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
