<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is total, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
