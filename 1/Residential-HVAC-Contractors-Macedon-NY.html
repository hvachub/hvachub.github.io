After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
