<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation. It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't troubled with it!

Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one component (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
