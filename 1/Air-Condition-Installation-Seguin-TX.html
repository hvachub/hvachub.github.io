<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
