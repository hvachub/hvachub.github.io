<p>Some cooling systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heatpump, therefore producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>Heatpump are a dream come true for folks in Seattle. Cooling is something that the majority of Seattleites will only utilize moderately, but since heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the best of both worlds! Not just are heatpump hassle-free, they are extremely energy efficient, too. The finest time to install air conditioning in your house may very well be when your heating system breaks down if a heat pump is in your future.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house systems, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.

Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
