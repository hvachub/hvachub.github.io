<p>A primary consider the avoidance of health signs is an effective, correctly designed and running ventilation system. The ventilation system identifies the quality of the indoor air by controlling the amount of air that is contributed to the workplace environment, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its contaminants are either tired to the re-circulated or outdoors throughout the building.<p>

Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
