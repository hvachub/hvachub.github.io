<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may see musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems.

<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the 2 need to not be puzzled. Where a geothermal HVAC taps into the heat inside the earth for area heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for creating power in the form of electrical power. The 2 operations utilize different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated up to boiling point to attain its objectives.<p>
