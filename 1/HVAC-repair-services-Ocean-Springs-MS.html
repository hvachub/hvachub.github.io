<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Gas furnace repair experts know that most mechanical failure in furnaces is due to faulty preliminary installation or a repair that wasnâ $ t made properly. Thatâ $ s why we suggest getting estimates for furnace repair and brand-new furnace installation from several HVAC companies. Learn more about every one, and work with the furnace repair and replacement company with a proven record of quality and knowledge.<p>
