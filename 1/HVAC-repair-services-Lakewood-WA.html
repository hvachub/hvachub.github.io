<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Lakewood WA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon hot water heater. It went great. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high effectiveness tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and set up all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heater. We picked getting something more costly than a traditional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew just what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
