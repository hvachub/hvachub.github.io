If your contractor says they understand the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone, transfer to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, determining the appropriate size of system for your home also depends upon the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outdoors your house.

They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are changing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
