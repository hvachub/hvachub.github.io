<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
