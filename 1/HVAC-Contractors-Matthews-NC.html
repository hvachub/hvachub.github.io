<h3>Air Condition System in Matthews NC 28105</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are utilized to seeing this enter the backyards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal components also. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms at the same time, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud devices in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who use this may invest more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
