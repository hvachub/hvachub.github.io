<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
