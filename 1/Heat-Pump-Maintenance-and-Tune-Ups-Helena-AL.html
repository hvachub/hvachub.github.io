<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
