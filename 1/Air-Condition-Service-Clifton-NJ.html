<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response information which show the health impacts of repetitive direct exposure to one particular chemical. Similar information is not readily available for long-lasting, low-level direct exposures to a combination of impurities as is the case for IAQ problems. Currently, there is not enough information readily available to forecast the results of exposure to a number of potentially harmful agents at the same time.<p>
