<p>When the heatpump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was very practical in gathering information on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance.

<p>If the AC does not turn off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in sufficient outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
