<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. The majority of home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants straight from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
