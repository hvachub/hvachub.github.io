Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
