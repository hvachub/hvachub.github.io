The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy area suggests that "Air Filtering ought to have a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Worth (MERV) of 13 as identified by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation required Air filters are utilized to minimize the amount of dust that reaches the damp coils.
