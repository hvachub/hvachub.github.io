<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, haze, or smog hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>

While there aren't many repairs you can make yourself, there specify maintenance procedures you can follow to keep your system running at peak performance.<p>
