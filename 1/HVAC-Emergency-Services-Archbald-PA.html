<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and preserving the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The very same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your house. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
