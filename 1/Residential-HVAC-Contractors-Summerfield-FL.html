All the wet hot air that goes through your HVAC coil, condenses. That humidity is then removed from the space that is being cooled. If your HVAC system is not draining pipes appropriately, you'll have a water leak. A restriction in your drain pipes triggers a water leak. There are various locations a blockage can occur. One of the primary areas where obstructions start to develop is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
