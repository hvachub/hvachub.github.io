<p>A primary consider the prevention of health symptoms is an effective, correctly developed and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system identifies the quality of the indoor air by managing the amount of air that is added to the work environment environment, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the office air and its toxins are either exhausted to the re-circulated or outdoors throughout the structure.<p>

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
