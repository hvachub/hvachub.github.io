<p>Expert heating unit setups. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC experts suggest following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the rate of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be using more energy than essential.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the very first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment and very large residences. Many steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the lack of moving parts makes them less prone to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
