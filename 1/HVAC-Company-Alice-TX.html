<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>

Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
