<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most commonly used on commercial buildings, but it is likewise a choice for house owners to consider. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself however likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost.
