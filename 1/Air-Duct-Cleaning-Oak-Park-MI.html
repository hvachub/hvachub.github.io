<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in the box. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storeroom has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and protect it from moisture.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heater, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
