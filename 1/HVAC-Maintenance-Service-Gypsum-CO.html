This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, specifies that a company must supply a healthy and safe work environment. Thus, making sure the air is of great quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source systems.

They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
