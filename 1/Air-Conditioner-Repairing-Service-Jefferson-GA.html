<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that exact same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience intermittent durations of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are clean, tidy them once again. Shut off the power. Flip the cooling service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then tug the disconnect block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work correctly after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
