This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump While room cooling offers optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more expensive than central air.<p>
