<p>Since an air conditioning system moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept clean. This implies that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
