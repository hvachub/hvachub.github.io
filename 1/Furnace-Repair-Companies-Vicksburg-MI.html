<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
