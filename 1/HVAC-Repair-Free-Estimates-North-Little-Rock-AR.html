<p>A geothermal desuperheater is beneficial and very effective, specifically during the Summertime while the system acts to cool one's house. This is due to the fact that the excess heat taken in from within your house is conducted into the warm water tank instead of being transmitted back into the earth. The result, for that reason, is complimentary hot water! Additionally, throughout winter, the heat from underground can be soaked up to heat domestic water together with its main purpose of offering space heating. This means that cost savings are still understood throughout the colder period. In fact, a desuperheater reduces winter water heating costs by around half.<p>

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in vehicles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this type of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
