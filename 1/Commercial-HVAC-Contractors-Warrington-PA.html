<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and houses matters, especially given that we invest the majority of our lives inside. A/c help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly damp environments or in cases where the air conditioner is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the a/c will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>A split air conditioner consists of two primary parts - a compressor located outside and a within air outlet system. Unlike a system that needs a series of ductwork networked throughout the ceiling, split air conditioning unit rely on a set of pipelines to connect the outside to the within air system which is why there are described as a ductless mini-split ac system installation Refrigerant is distributed through the copper pipelines that cycle through the system to generate either cold or heated air.<p>
