<p>AC units and thermostats have integrated hold-up functions when they're closed down and after that repowered. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately harden and cure-- generally two to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
