<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
