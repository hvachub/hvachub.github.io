<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your home. A 2500 square foot house will need a much larger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capacity to keep temperatures comfy. Other aspects that can affect this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the structure, roof, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>

Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
