<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to reduce the amount of energy required for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps must likewise be required to lessen pollution from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for advised actions.)

Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems.
