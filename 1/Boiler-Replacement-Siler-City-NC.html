<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance items that only a qualified HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools required to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the necessary equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still essential to have a professional technician check the system occasionally.<p>

However more complex issues-- identified by consistently inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a various tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods listed below might be suitable.<p>
