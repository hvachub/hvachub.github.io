<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<p>They were great! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for.
