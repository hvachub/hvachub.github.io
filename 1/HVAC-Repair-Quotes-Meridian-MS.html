<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This decreases the interior system footprint and allows each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heat pump While room air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
