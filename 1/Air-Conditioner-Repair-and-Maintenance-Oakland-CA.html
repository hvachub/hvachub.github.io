<h3>Boiler Cleaning Service in Oakland California</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To minimize contaminants, we recommend setting up sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to eliminate the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems likewise help manage bacteria and natural odors. Many store-bought filters can not remove these tiniest of allergens and do not get rid of gases and bacteria.<p>
