<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
