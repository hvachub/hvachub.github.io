<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
