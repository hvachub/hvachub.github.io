Many makers state on service warranty documentation that installation and maintenance by a licensed HVAC service provider are a part of the warranty conditions. When you have a ten-year parts restricted warranty as is standard on Carrier Â® heaters, you'll want to be sure you keep that protection legitimate for the complete 10 years.<p>
