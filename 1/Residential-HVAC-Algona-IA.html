<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

<p>I am extremely amazed with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.

I will absolutely be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
