<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your clothes dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply asking for mold accumulation, states Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a uncomplicated and reliable  technique to minimize ambient air pollution and prospective health dangers, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions.
