The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power should not go beyond the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not basic, given that it considers not only the small power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

Air-side economizers likewise utilize outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when appropriate.<p>
