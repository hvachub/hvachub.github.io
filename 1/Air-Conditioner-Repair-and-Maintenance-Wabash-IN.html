<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might require a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Image 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
