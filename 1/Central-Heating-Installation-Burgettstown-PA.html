<p>There are lots of sources of indoor air contamination in any house.

So, ensure to choose based upon how often you will utilize your heating system, the load that will be placed on it and the frequency with which you plan on having it serviced each year.

Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in watering down the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
