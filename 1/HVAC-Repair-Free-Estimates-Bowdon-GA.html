<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Bowdon GA 30108</h3>
<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to examine scenario & chose to opt for them for the work.

<p>This is particularly significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Air toxins can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to harmful gas leaks. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older homes might include asbestos and lead particles, which can be harming to the lungs when released into the air. In kitchens and restrooms, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are typically greater than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products include vinyl asbestos floor tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These products provide a danger just when they are handled in a manner that develops dust containing asbestos fibers which can be breathed in. When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disrupted by repair, redesigning, or demolition activities, microscopic fibers can end up being air-borne if proper controls are not in location. This can result in the potential for significant illness.<p>
