<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Clinton IA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to check the a/c prior to you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't block the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home. Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and really carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
