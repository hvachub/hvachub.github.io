<p>Proper ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same contaminants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>More typical in fairly older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses oil, electrical power or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms.

More recent gas boilers should achieve 80 percent AFUE and newer fossil-fueled boilers must achieve a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>Many individuals underestimate the level of the indoor air pollution issue. Air pollution is typically pictured as the black smoke given off from factories. Little idea is given to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, pesticides, cleaners, and paints used in the home.

<p>Energy performance can be enhanced a lot more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This enables a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heater the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely crucial to preserving a correct temperature level.<p>
<p>Chandler's team got here on time and carried out a 71 item maintenance inspection checklist.
