<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the proper temperature. Heaters that kick on often might be due to a filthy filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled and even a filthy burner.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators utilized flammable or hazardous gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could lead to fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
