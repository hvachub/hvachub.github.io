<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and check. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Efficient heating and a/c services are important for each Florida house owner. In the hot, humid climate of the higher Tampa Bay area, you need an air conditioner that will keep both the heat and humidity at bay. Winters come with occasional bursts of cold weather condition that make a touch of heat incredibly welcome. From heating and cooling to indoor air quality, Scott's One Hour Air Conditioning & Heating has you covered.<p>
<p>Outdoor impurities. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a home, outside particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and irritants discovered in outside air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates. Specialists recommend using filters with a MERV 6-8, but greater MERV levels trap smaller sized particles and generally are better suited for those with allergies or where the indoor environment has a high concentration of mold spores, dust particles, or other allergens.<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>The most common type of home heating system in the U.S. burns gas or gas to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to set up, they are not the least expensive option, but more recent systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems usually accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, extremely efficient natural gas heaters can attain AFUE scores as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is flowed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
