<p>I normally do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
