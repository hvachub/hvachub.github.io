<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Beech Island South Carolina</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an additional $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was type of odd being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged.

So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which usually includes a filter change - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of contamination.<p>
