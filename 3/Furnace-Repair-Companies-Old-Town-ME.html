My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
