<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of affordable ones got.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
