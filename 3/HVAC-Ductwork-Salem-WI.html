<p>Structures are developed or intended to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean, sanitize, and preserve surfaces to boost their efficiency, durability, or look. In other cases, such modifications discreetly and even drastically modify buildings in ways that may be necessary to their own stability or their effect on building occupants through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that define them at any time. We might discover it beneficial to combine the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, a few of the techniques utilized by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an enhanced understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>
<p>Because the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was initially driven by increasing energy expenses, and has more recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system efficiency can also assist increase occupant health and efficiency. 21 In the United States, the EPA has imposed tighter limitations throughout the years. There are numerous methods for making HVAC systems more efficient.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis might end up being clogged, lowering air flow distribution, volume, and quality. They also might end up being locations for molds and bacteria to be and grow dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise must be properly kept to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>

This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
