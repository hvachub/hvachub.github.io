<h3>Gas Boiler Repair in Simsbury Connecticut</h3>
<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Several initiatives imagine to minimize indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
