<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
