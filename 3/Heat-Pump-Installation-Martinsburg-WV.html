<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the primary issue. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more troubles, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c individually for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
