<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
