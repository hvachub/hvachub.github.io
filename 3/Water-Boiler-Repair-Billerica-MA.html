There can be a major threat from the cumulative effects of these sources. Luckily, there are steps that many people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid new problems from occurring. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to assist you decide whether to do something about it that can minimize the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
