Throughout the summer and winter seasons, central air systems and furnaces supply enough cooling and heating power to houses in Redmond. The average daytime temperature level highs range from the low to upper-70s throughout June, July, and August, and when heat waves pass through the community, temperature levels will rise to the mid-80s. When correctly installed and well maintained, central air conditioning systems keep locals of Redmond comfortable and cool inside.<p>

The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, implying they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same method as a cars and truck radiator or common home air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
