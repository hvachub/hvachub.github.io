<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to discover a place that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Due to the fact that it tires warm air out the top, do not place the condenser under a deck or completely enclose it. Any air flow constraint will lower the system's efficiency. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily distribute around it.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outside, air quality tracking platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are becoming more common as readily available solutions in residential and commercial HVAC product bundles.
