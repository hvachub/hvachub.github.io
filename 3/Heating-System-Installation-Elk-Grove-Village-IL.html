<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. You can prevent all these issues by making certain that your system is inspected frequently, as this will avoid even minor repairs from ending up being huge concerns.

<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient. Central air conditioning systems and heatpump generally last about 10-15 years. Ductless split systems can last as much as 20 years. If your system is near, or past, its anticipated life-span, replacement might be the most economical option.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater is more dependable than alternatives, and is not impacted by any external factors, unlike other renewable energies such as wind energy and solar energy. For example, wind energy can just be utilized when there is wind, while solar power depends on routine sunlight to work effectively. Geothermal heating is dependent on neither the sun nor the wind, but rather takes its heat from the earth's crust, which is always hot. This makes geothermal heating a trusted and offered source of energy.<p>

<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
