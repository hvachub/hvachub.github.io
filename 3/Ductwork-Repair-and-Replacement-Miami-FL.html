<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
