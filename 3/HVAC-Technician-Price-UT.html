<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, eye, and nose and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema.
