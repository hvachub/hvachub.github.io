<h3>Why You Want Air Conditioning Repair in Ada OK?</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  option through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transmitting the soaked up heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
