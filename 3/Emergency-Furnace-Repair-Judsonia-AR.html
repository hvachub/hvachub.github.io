<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac units and thermostats have built-in hold-up functions. The hold-up can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you have actually registered for an energy-saving gadget from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you have actually installed the parts revealed and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was really valuable in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to briefly manage the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear interaction about the issue, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely use Stability Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
