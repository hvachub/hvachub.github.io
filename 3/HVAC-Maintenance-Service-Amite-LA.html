<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning unit back into its original box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to safeguard it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place two 2x4s underneath package to raise it up and secure it from wetness.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Image 6).<p>
