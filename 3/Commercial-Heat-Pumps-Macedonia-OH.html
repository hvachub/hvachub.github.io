<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center.

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the exact same way as an automobile radiator or typical household air conditioning system does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which should be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled location to the outdoors air.<p>
