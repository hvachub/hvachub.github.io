<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Waterford PA</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones received. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools far better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 system it changed (also Carrier).<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
