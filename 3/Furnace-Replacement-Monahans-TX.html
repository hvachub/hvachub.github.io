<p>We required 2 visits - Jake came out first and was very experienced and enjoyable and courteous. Grant came out a couple days later and was also well-informed and great to speak to. They both did a terrific job. Sabre's office staff is very valuable, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Definitely recommend.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. An excellent location to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it!

Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as simply one component (out of lots of) of a comfortable environment.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size.
