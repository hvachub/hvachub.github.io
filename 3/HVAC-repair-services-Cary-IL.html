<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My oldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it really didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
