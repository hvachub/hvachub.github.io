<p>Sean was very handy. He is a very pleasant person to work with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
