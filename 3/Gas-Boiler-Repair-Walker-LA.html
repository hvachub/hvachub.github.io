<h3>Baseboard Heaters in Walker LA 70785</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and go over choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>Brian was every bit sincere, responsive and pleasant. Jeremiah Bartula the plumbing technician discussed our options prior to our deal with Brian and was extraordinary, useful and helpful - his work was impeccable! All of his assistants were diligent and courteous. The work website was left absolutely cleared and cleaned up. We would extremely encourage others to go right to Berkshire Heating and A/c for all their heating and cooling needs.<p>

The technician who described our choices did an outstanding task in ensuring we understood the pros and cons of each choice. The professionals who installed the brand-new system were professional and fast, while taking some time to make sure we understood how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
