By contrast, changing a furnace and checking filter can typically be done in simply a few minutes, often with no tools required. As a preventative measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
