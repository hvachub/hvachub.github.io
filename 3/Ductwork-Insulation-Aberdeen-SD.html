Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an ac system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, search for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
