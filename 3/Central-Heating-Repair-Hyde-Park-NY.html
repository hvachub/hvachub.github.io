<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
