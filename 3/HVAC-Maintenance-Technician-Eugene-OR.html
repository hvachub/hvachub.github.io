<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a tube two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut off the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
