<h3>Electric Furnace in Douglasville GA 30135</h3>
<p>We contacted Elite HEATING AND COOLING on one of the most popular days of summer( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess situation & chose to choose them for the work. I more than happy to state that not just did we get the central air going however likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we spoke to from starting to end were really expert, polite and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
