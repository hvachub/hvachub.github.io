To make sure the unit you pick is the ideal size for your home, the Sears HVAC specialist does an electronic load estimation quote to identify the exact type of heat and a/c system that's perfect for your home-we do not just change it with the same size system you currently have.

Change the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
