<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office complex such as health centers and skyscrapers, automobiles such as cars, trains, ships, aircrafts and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
