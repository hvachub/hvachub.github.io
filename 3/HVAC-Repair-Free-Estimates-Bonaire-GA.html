<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Bonaire GA 31005</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 rule but got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
