<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
