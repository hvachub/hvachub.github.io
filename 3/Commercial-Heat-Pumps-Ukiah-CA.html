<p>Sean was extremely useful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems other than the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
