<p>I normally do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a household pal and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
