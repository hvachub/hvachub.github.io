<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor system. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>I highly recommend using this service. Extremely trustworthy exceptionally good. Looked after a part that was not covered under service warranty fast and efficient and did not need to pay an arm and a leg to get it done. Terrific company started by a person who is looking to grow his business and protect his household. He set up a complete system inside and out. Terrific system and a great price. I am currently on the maintance strategy. He looks after it two times a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
