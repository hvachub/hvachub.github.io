<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for quotes. While both were helpful and practical, Ballard Gas gave us a much better offer, for remarkable service. Instead of an easy sales job, the owner of the company made a complete evaluation of our heating system and located methods we might have more even heat. He consisted of these small but considerable modifications in his quote. Due to the fact that of current warmer summers and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company because the two technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>My eldest son constantly complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I realized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 year old AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air purification system and thermostat. The technician who discussed our choices did an excellent task in ensuring we understood the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The professionals who set up the new system were fast and professional, while requiring time to make sure we comprehended how the new system worked. Overall a first rate experience.<p>
