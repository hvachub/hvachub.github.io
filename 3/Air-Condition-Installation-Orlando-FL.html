<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young kids can be severe. They include hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral problems. Infants, fetuses, and children are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more conscious the damaging effects of lead. Children might have higher direct exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can occur gradually since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should work up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>

While an area heater remains in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
