There are several reasons why your Nest appears dead or has a blank screen. We'll be discussing why you may be having difficulty with your Nest smart thermostat. Inspect your emergency breakers first. You should have the correct amount of high voltage going to your furnace. If you have the appropriate 120 volts of power going to the furnace, check.

<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Mars PA 16046</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hours and a reasonable price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in discussing what services would be performed. Also Camryn offered terrific customer care at the end of the consultation by explaining precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually done in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to vaporize, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
