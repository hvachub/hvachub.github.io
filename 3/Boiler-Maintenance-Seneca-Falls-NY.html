<p>Due to the fact that it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted during the combustion process. Today's designs vary from a minimum of 78% approximately 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a home without ducting, installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive.<p>
