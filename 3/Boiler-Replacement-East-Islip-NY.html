<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. Connection problems along the line that provides power to your furnace can compromise the performance of the system.

Part of maintaining your furnace involves examining the advised connections along with temperature level and pressure assesses. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are protected and tight.<p>

<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 major components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
