<h3>Choosing the Right Business For Heating and AC Systems in Lees Summit MO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
