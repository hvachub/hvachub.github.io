<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. In other words, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Kids, infants, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead exposure than grownups given that lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more conscious the harmful results of lead. Kids might have greater direct exposures since they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<p>A specialized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a standard air conditioning system in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the exact same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
