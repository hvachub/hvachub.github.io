<p>Utilizing a range hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to change the burner so that the flame pointer is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you buy a brand-new gas stove or range. Never use a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
