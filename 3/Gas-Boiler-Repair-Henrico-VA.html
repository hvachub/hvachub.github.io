<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of adequate ventilation, which results in a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main problem in over half the workplace indoor air examinations it has carried out. Investigations carried out in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the very same to be real. These investigations revealed that correct ventilation is important in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 must be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
