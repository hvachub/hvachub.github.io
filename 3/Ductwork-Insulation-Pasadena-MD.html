<p>When mounting a wall sensor, think about the height at which they should be put. Most typically they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific location.

For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
