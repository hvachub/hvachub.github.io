<p>Geothermal heat pump cost is much more than other heat pump types when installing the entire system. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running numerous backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is quite pricey. Setting up a new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
