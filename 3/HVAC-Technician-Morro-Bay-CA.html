<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
