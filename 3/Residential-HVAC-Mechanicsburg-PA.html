<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two should not be confused.
