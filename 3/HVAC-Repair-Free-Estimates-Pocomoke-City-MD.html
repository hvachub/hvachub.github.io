<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the very same time, because the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, since it considers not only the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
