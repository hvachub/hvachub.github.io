<p>Routine maintenance keeps a furnace working effectively, according to HVAC specialists like Dave Mejean of B&W Pipes & Heating in Indianapolis.

<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair at East Elmhurst NY</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high effectiveness heating system. We decided on getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our most significant utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new system will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year.
