<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the floor surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other articles with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furniture and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>There's a big difference in between the heat transfer of radiation and the other typical form of house heating-- convection. Over the past century, the majority of homes in chillier climates were heated by convection, rather than radiation. Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the walls, ceilings and floorings heated. In turn, the items in the space, like furniture and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
