<h3>Why Choose a Natural Gas Furnace at Salisbury NC?</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, sending the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas relocates to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>When our faithful clients call us for furnace repair on a cold winter's night, we know they require our help immediately; not next week.
