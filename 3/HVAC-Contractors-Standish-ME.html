Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head location. All things in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature level after the radiant heat system has been running for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>
