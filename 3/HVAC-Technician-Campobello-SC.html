<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka.

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
