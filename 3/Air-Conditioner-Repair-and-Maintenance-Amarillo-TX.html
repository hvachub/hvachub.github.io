<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and after that determine the height and width of the opening. Make certain to have those measurements on hand when buying an a/c to guarantee it'll fit comfortably into the window.

To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by specialists, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
