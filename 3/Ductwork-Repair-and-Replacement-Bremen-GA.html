<p>An indoor air toxin is a compound in the air that may impact the health of individuals who live in the house.

There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this. A common aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
