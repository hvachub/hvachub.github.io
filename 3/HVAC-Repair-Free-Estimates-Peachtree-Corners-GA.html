<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable growth or a musty smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for bids. While both were helpful and helpful, Ballard Natural Gas provided us a better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these minor but significant modifications in his bid.
