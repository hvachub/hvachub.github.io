<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outdoor air).<p>

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold.

To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
