<p>There are a few possibilities to explain short biking in very cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands placed on the system due to the extremely low temperature levels. In some cases, the furnace will simply run harder to maintain a warm climate for your house when the weather condition is extremely cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clarity on this concern, contact one of our technicians.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
