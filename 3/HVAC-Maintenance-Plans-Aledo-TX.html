<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
