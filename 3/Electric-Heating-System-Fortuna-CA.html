<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of recurring use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. , if that customer had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.. a very beneficial result and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
