<p>Initially make sure the air filter is tidy and in good condition if you notice a decrease in heat output. Next, check other components of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, dust and debris, an inexpensive fix that can help increase efficiency. Likewise, examine the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned correctly. Attempt moving it far from direct sunshine given that this may affect temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your house. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your home feeling cold if this happens. You may also need to examine your insulation to ensure that warm air does not leave from your space through different openings.<p>
