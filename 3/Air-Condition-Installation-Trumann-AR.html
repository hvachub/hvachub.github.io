As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the system has been running issue free for the previous 2+ years.
