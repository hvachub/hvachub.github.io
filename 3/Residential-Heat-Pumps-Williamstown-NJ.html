<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
