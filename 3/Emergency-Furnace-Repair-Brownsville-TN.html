<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold.

The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
