<p>Having a wood-burning heater can be exceptionally efficient in regards to cost. If you have access to cheap or free firewood, or you cut your own wood from your timber, it may not cost you anything at all.

Convection is the process of heating air and blowing it about the rooms for the warm air to keep the floors, walls and ceilings warmed. In turn, the objects in the space, like furnishings and people, would remain warm by virtue of the air temperature.<p>
