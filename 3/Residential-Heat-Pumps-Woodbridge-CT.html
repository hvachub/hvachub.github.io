<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Business in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year ago and they've been to your house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced reasonably, have dealt with the one repair I needed well, and are always on-time and professional. Have actually been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is definitely the very best I've had the opportunity to work with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has actually been terrific.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
