<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a reasonably easy to measure surrogate for indoor toxins discharged by people, and associates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are abnormally high indoors might trigger occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to function at lower activity levels. Outdoor CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level thought about appropriate is 1000 ppm. 28 Human beings are the main indoor source of co2 in most buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are an indication of the adequacy of outside air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>Utilize or open windows exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common approach of decreasing direct exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will reduce but not get rid of exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Since cigarette smoking produces such big quantities of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation methods do not remove them from the air in your house as rapidly as they build up. In addition, the large increases in ventilation it takes to substantially lower exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses significantly. As a result, the most reliable way to decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke in the house is to eliminate smoking cigarettes there.<p>
