<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth.

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
