<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning system". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy.

The outside condenser system likewise changes roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
