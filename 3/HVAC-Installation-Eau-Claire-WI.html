<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
