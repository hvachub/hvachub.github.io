<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own homes and my real estate clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different costs and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the unit working again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem.
