<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his workers, equipment expenses, marketing, utilities, and other costs prior to paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% typically isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their revenues while keeping costs the very same in all other locations.<p>
