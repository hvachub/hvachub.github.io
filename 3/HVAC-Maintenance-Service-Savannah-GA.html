Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00.

<h3>Components of a High Efficiency Furnace at Savannah GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the entire day as they required to eliminate the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating system.
