<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Lake Orion MI</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
