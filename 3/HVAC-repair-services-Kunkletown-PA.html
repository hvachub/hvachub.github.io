<p>All homes require reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a broken thermostat, preventing the furnace from adapting to the correct temperature. Heaters that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air effectively. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal concern. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a dirty burner.<p>
