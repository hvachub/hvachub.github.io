<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to select products that will avoid indoor air issues from occurring - a number of them are pointed out here. Initially, utilize exterior-grade pressed wood items made with phenol-formaldehyde resin in floors, cabinets, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider utilizing solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, make sure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes damp.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>When installed, underfloor heating needs virtually no maintenance and features a 30 Year Assurance for total comfort.
