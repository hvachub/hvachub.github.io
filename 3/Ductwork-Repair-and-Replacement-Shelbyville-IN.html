<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air contamination problem exists. Excessive re-circulation of air results in "stale air" conditions.

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year.

Hope this assists.<p>
