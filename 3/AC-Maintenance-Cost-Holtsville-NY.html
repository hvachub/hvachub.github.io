<p>Heating is the largest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is transformed to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
<p>A SEER rating means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER ranking of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Basically, SEER provides more information based upon how the EER carries out in various temperatures. The greater the system's SEER rating, the more energy efficient it is. 1 A system's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
