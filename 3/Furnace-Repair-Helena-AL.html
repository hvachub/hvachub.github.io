<p>Under-timber piping is where hydronic piping is set within a wood floor joist system, beneath the wooded subsurface and final flooring finish. This is normally utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  area and benefits from the flooring joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and extra thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system effective, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
