<p>Increasing energy costs are not the only factor for high expenses. Heating systems frequently lose their performance as they age, specifically if they have not been properly maintained. As an outcome your oil or natural gas furnace may run longer to provide the exact same amount of heat. This will trigger your energy bills to go up.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by lots of people.<p>
