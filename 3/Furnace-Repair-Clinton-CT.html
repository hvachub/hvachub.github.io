<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, controlling the power to the heating wires and likewise regulating the temperature level of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either runs to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entranceway of the room they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the area is unobstructed and dry.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts decades, because it is secured inside your home. When it does need to be changed, the expense is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, given that the loop or well is the most pricey to install. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some poorly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground gradually, to the point that the system no longer had adequate of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>

Irritants found in indoor air are mostly biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold.
