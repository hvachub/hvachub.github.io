<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
