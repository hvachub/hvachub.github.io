<p>Details provided in this safety guide is based upon existing clinical and technical understanding of the problems presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air conditioning systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be offered for your home's systems.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall.

Because an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
