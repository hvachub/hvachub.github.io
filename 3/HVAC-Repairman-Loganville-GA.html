<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment usually lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire brand-new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
