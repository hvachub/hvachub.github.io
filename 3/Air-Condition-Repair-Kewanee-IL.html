This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
