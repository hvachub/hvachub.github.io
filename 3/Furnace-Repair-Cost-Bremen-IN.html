<p>If you require furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and said it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the task, but they had to order it. My better half said that she had seen a terrific evaluation for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the best, most decent people I have actually met in a long period of time.

Now the "hard part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
