<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians often find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at differing temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the same period. Essentially, SEER provides more data based on how the EER performs in various temperatures. The greater the unit's SEER score, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be discovered on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
