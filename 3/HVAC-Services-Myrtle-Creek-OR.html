<p>I have been using them for several years for my businesses, my own houses and my real estate clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different rates and various issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he recommended me to contact service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, reputable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a sincere AC person and I'm delighted I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
