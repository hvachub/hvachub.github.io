<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>A/c can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
