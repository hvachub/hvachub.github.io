Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly found someone to properly service and the unit has actually been operating issue complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
