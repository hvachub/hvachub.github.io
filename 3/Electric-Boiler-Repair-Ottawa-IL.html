If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the reduced air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the issue.<p>
