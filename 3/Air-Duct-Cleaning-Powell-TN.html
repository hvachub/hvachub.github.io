<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might notice musty or unpleasant smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your physician about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>The steadiness of the market's growth doesn't always translate to the experience of running an HVAC company. The air, heating and ventilation conditioning organisation tends to run cold and hot. Demand heats up throughout the summertime and winter when clients require their HVAC systems repaired for relief versus the cold and heat; service calls drop off when milder weather condition gets here.<p>
