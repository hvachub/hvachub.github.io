<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
