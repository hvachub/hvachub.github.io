<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in place. In addition, the concrete outcomes of a PM is typically tough to measure, as one response stated the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented.

If that client had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the part.  a very useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
