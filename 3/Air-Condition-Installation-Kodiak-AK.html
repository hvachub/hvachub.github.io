<p>Correct ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality exterior is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same pollutants. Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The results of lead direct exposure on fetuses and children can be serious. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Babies, fetuses, and kids are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of little kids are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids might have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
