<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Think about prospective impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater appropriately adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is normally an indicator of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While an area heating unit is in usage, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
