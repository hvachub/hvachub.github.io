<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
