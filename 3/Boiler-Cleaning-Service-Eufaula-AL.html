Because it exhausts warm air out the top, don't place the condenser under a deck or entirely confine it. Any airflow restriction will reduce the system's efficiency. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>. Before choosing the installation place of a/c, numerous main factors need to be considered.
