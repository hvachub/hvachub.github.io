<p>Appropriate ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The company began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature clients for years, till the mandate for high-efficiency units required Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under numerous owners. Goodrich's father was a Goettl dealer in Las Vegas, so when the opportunity came to buy what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow paths, ventilation system components, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has actually been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
