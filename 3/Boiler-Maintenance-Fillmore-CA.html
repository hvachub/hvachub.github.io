Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure.

<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the outside coil and the indoor coil. This indicates that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

Purchased a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
