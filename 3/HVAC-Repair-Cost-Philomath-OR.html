<p>Specialist heater setups. For any contractor, HVAC or otherwise, these companies provide opportunities they can't achieve by themselves. A lot of owners stick with the bigger firms after acquisition. In many cases, the acquisition supplies a way for the seller to retire and make certain workers are looked after.

<p>If you suspect a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and check. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
