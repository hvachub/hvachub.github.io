<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

It's time to call an expert if at any point in the procedure of bleeding the furnace something appears strange or you lose confidence.
