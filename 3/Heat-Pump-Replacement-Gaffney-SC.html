<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
