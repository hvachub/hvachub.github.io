<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you must inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
