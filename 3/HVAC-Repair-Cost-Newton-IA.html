<p>Examine these three things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

For a higher-end model to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant disadvantage of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
