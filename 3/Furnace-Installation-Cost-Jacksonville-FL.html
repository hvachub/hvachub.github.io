<p>A health survey must be developed and dispersed to all concerned workers. Such a tool should determine the number of individuals affected; define ages and job descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they are located within the workplace; show when the signs happen (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of particular health signs or health problems; recognize all devices run in the work environment; indicate the kind of outside air contamination; and identify prospective sources of task stress.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices generally lasts decades, since it is protected inside. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most pricey to set up. New technical guidelines remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did get too hot or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more challenging to control than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such information can often be gotten by requesting copies of air tracking information from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this information may recognize potentially hazardous sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
