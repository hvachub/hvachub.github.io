<p>While contaminant levels from specific sources may not posture a significant health threat on their own, the majority of homes have more than one source that adds to indoor air contamination. There can be a major danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to decrease the danger from existing sources and to prevent new issues from happening. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Epa (EPA) and the U.S. Customer Item Safety Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to act that can reduce the level of indoor air pollution in your own home.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be required.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to appropriately cool the home on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
