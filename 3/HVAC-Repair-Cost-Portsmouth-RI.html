This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Heatpump work on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This permits them to produce two to three times as much heat as a standard electric heater (like a space heating unit) with the same quantity of electrical power. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
