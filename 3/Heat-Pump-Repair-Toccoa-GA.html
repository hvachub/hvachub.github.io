<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't use this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around repairing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He needed to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will definitely utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
