<h3>Choosing the Right Company For Heating and AC Systems in Ellisville MS</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various home performance upgrades (furnace, water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to help us dispute which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never felt hurried and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's services and products was outstanding. Taylor assisted us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heat pump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to save on cost.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
