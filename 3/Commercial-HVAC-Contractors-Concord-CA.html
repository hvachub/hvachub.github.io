<p>The primary health impact related to direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
