<h3>Portable Air Conditioner in Lyons New York</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>A number of efforts envisage to minimize indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from items.
