<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the world, consisting of EMV. He's stated a number of times that the special code feature is many and optional, many sellers don't use it since it slows down transactions a lot more due to the back-and-forth communications needed. I don't know enough about the technology to know if that is even possible.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summer a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Sometimes an old a/c system needs to be replaced for cost, performance, or other factors. However, selecting an air conditioner is never ever a one-size-fits-all situation.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just today I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
