<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are built. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations develop inside, direct exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>Most central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your home streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
