<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be established to supply threshold informs. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has actually reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the appropriate action to solve the circumstance immediately.<p>
