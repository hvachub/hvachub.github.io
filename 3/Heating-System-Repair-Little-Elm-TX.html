<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that installs on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency advantage because up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts. Because they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that immediately raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>

These limits might not be suitable in office settings or for the home.<p>
