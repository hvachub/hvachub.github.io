<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. On the day of the consultation he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested informing me about our system, and left having fixed the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not replacing the entire part. He got along, straightforward and a completely pleasurable person to have around that whole time. His time and knowledge to SOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company just to do a somewhat unsure diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>What takes place when you have an emergency? The first reaction of most people is to stress.

<p>We got in touch with Elite HVACS on one of the hottest days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to examine situation & decided to opt for them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air conditioning going however likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everyone we talked with from beginning to end were very expert, courteous and the work was really efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>These men have been terrific. At a real estate agent, I often require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what deal with a house might cost. Recently I required to call on these men twice. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense price quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's a business design they take seriously. You men are officially on speed dial. Talk to you soon.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is IMPORTANT TO protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, pick your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales methods that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
