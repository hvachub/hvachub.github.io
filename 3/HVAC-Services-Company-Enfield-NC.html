<p>RMI is working to change that, beginning in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>To secure family members with asthma or to minimize the possibility that somebody in the house might develop asthma, the house needs to be examined for possible indoor asthma activates. Each space in the house has potential asthma activates. Some problems can be repaired quickly, however others may require more time and work to control or eliminate asthma sets off. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical odors and scents, add to indoor air pollution and have been known to asthma signs in sensitive individuals.

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the same. When the electrical wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately solidify and treat-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
