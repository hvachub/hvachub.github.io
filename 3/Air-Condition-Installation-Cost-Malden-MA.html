<p>In houses, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood items used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furniture); wood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board includes a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not cause indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases release pollutants.) Nevertheless, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, prior to the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement floor drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
