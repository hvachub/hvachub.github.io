<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Normally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the goal of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
