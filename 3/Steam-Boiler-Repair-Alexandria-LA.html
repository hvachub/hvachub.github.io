<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that perfect temperature throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining a few of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause difficulty for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters regularly, or get a cooling service strategy which normally consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Biological pollutants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these pollutants through the house.<p>
