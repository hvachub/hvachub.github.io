<p>Lots of commercial structures use mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that belong to the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can likewise make use of natural ventilation by opening windows or doors. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outdoor air introduced into a space per a system of time, and is typically expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm).
