<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
