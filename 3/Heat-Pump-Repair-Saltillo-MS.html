<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
