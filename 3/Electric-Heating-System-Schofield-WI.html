<p>Fact: Federal and local rewards generally amount to in between 30 and 60 percent of overall geothermal system cost, which can often make the initial price of a system competitive with traditional equipment. Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capability, during new construction (homes generally use between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load.
