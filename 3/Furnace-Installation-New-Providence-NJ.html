<p>A packaged system, generally installed on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those looking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, considering that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically only offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system.
