<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
