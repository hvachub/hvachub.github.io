<p>Among the drawbacks of central heating is that it's possibly expensive to set up, specifically in an older house. Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause problems if you're highly allergic to dust. In addition, specific fuels and equipment may need unique authorizations, and there is restricted flexibility in the event of altered heating requirements. During usage, there is a dead time while heat is being carried from the heating system to the home.<p>
<p>Most well and city water does not typically include lead. Water normally picks up lead inside the home from family plumbing that is made with lead products. The only way to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.
