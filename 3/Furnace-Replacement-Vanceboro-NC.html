<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
