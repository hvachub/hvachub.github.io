<h3>Comparing Commercial Boilers to Residential Boilers at Powell OH</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went excellent. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heating system. We chose getting something more costly than a traditional water heater as gas is among our most significant utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>

<h3>Furnace Service in Powell OH 43065</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my alternatives. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace failed within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers service warranty would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they diagnosed the problem and repaired extremely rapidly. Absolutely A++ installation and service.<p>
