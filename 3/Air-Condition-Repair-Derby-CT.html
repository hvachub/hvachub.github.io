<p>Immediate effects might show up after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are normally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is merely removing the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up not long after direct exposure to some indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are organic chemicals given off as gases from items or processes; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water usage.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are beginning to feature mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the house. A few of these styles include energy-efficient heat healing ventilators (likewise known as air-to-air heat exchangers). For additional information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Conservation and Renewable Resource Questions and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
