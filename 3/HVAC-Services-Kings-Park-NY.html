<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound considering that 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not go beyond the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, considering that the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that a few of the rooms may not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER score of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the exact same period.
