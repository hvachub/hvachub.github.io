<p>If you work in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your pastime includes lead, you may unwittingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothing. You might also be tracking in lead from soil around your house. Soil extremely near homes may be infected from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by roadways and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from automobiles and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to clean your feet prior to going into the home. Alter your clothing before you go home and clean these clothing separately if you work with lead in your job or a pastime. Encourage your kids to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with fingers and toys. Attempt to keep your kids from consuming dirt, and make certain they clean their hands when they come within.<p>
