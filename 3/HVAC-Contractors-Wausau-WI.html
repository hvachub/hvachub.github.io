We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more damaging than the air exterior.<p>
