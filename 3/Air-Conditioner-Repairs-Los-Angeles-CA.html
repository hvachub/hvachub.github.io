<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Oil heating systems are less typical now than gas, however they can be helpful in more remote areas where utilities are more difficult to access, and in colder environments due to the fact that it provides more heat per BTU than other services.
