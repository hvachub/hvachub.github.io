<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI safeguarded.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we elected to set up a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio.
