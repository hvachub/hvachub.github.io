<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its efficiency.<p>
