<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system.

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
