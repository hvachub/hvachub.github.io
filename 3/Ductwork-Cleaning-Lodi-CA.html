<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
