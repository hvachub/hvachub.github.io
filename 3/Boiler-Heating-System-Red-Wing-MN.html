Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>
