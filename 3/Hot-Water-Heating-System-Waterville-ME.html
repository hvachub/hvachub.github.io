<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Waterville ME</h3>
<p>Sometimes, heating repairs are simply not possible. Maybe your furnace is too old, your heatpump is too damaged, or your boiler just can't be repaired. Whatever the case, certain circumstances call for full-scale heating replacement. At Horizon Services, we have actually been helping homeowners throughout Delaware, Southern New Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and Northeastern Maryland change their houses' heating systems when their old ones are no longer practical.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
