<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends upon individual level of sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological or chemical toxins after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head location. All objects in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which unexpected shot of coolness when it turns off.<p>

No 2 systems are precisely the same, but filter modifications are something we offer throughout PM check outs if the customer needs it- specifically the inaccessible filters- since we understand how important it is that they be changed out & how difficult it can be for a home owner to do it.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your cars and truck. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and debris in the air. When every 3 months, Energy Star suggests changing your filter. During high usage months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
