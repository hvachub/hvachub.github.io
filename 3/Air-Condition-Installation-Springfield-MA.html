<h3>Air Conditioning And Heating Companies in Springfield Massachusetts</h3>
<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't use agreements.  The so called reputable companies dupe more people than the fly by night attire. Because I tried to work for them, I understand. Since 90% of them are criminals, I quit. They walk in with or without a contract and begin offering you things you do not require. They lie. How do I understand. I now work as an expert to verify the so called issues and solutions. 9 out of 10, I inspect are totally incorrect.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash being available in each month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
