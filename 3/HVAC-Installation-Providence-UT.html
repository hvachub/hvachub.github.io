<p>Particular instant impacts resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is frequently tough to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is very important to take notice of the time and place the signs occur. If the signs fade or disappear when an individual is far from the home and return when the person returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects might be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions widespread in the home.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime air conditioning. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have been extremely delighted with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealer) and service (today Braxten finished yearly maintenance of our system). Trane heat pump has actually worked very well and is so effective that it substantially minimized our utility expenditures - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years. The couple of times we require them for emergencies they responded rapidly and fixed the issue.<p>
