<p>A specialized air conditioning unit that is used only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit because both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the exact same air course. A basic a/c unit transfers heat out of the room due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually warmed, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the same amount of power.<p>
