<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require relatively little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system functioning smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank should be looked for leakages, the system must be flushed periodically to remove tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water locations).

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
