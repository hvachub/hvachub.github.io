<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Lake View NY Home Owners</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The present pattern in house building and construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in roofing systems, walls, and floorings. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has caused an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh cosmetics air helps and waters down indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
