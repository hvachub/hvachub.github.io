<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it releases radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into houses through dirt floorings, fractures in concrete walls and floorings, floor drains, and sumps. When radon ends up being trapped in buildings and concentrations develop inside, exposure to radon ends up being a concern.<p>

A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, including installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in rate from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning occurs when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The goal is to provide sufficient modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this. A typical element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
