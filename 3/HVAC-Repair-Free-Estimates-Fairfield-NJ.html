Simply put, sometimes the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>

Let the system cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, situated in the compressor's gain access to panel.<p>
