"Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.

<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and after that change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
