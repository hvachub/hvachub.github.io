Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve).

If the valves on the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
