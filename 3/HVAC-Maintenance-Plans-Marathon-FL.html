<p>To determine the correct size of oil furnace you need for your house, calculate the home's square footage and determine what zone your home remains in.

Multiply the length and width of each room in your home that you heat and accumulate all the rooms together to get your overall square footage.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
