<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and contaminant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw floor plans on a "sketchpad" and utilize "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
