<p>Your Review This is my 3rd time using Around the Clock. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating problem in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is experienced with these gadgets). I have absolutely nothing but fantastic things to state - he has taken great care of my heating and AC needs. Quick response - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Regardless of the kind of electric radiant floor heating system, all are factory-built to remain in one piece and not cut, broken or changed. Any interference or disruption in the circulation of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is one of the downsides to setting up an electric convected heat system. However, assuming they are set up properly and effectively looked after, the possibility of them having issues is small.<p>
