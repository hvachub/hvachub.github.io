<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently throughout the milder temperatures, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.<p>

A professional maintenance technician will flush and clean the condensate drain to guarantee all excess moisture streams away from the system.<p>
