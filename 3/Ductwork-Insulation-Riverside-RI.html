<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
