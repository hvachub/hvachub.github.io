<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. When I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<h3>The Way to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Kathleen GA</h3>
<p>A hydronic radiant flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes set up under the flooring or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the hot water transfers to the floor mass and then radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not rely on heating or moving air to transfer warmth.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
