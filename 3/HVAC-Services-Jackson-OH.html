<p>Frequently, indoor air quality issues in big commercial structures can not be successfully determined or fixed without a detailed building examination. These examinations might start with written questionnaires and telephone consultations in which building investigators evaluate the history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. Sometimes, these queries might quickly reveal the issue and on-site check outs are unnecessary.<p>
<p>There is no easy response, but lots of utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better solution. If the present system has not sustained other significant repairs, remains in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that led to the breakdown can be determined and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense as well.<p>
