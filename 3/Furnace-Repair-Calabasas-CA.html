I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually choosy with my stuff. I like my devices and home appliances initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs.

Am happy I got this however due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in good production. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this brand-new Provider I got given that I purchased it 7 months back. Itâ $ s simply best.<p>
