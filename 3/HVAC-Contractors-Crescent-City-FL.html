<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating devices can last for many years. However if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel costs suddenly appear greater than normal, it is probably time to consider a new system. New heating equipment is much more effective-- you'll see lower fuel expenses right now, not to discuss the money you'll save on repair expenses. If your heating unit is 25 years of ages or more, you can probably expect to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
