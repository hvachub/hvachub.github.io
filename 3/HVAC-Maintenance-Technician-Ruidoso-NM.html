<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are used to seeing this type in the yards of homes. With split system units, the majority of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. However, there are some internal parts as well. Split systems are perfect for cooling multiple spaces simultaneously, but are not really energy effective. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the home.

Packaged units are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, considering that the system is combined.

Therefore, this may not be the very best choice for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller budget plans.<p>
