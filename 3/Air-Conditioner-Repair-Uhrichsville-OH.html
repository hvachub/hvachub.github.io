<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if entirely iced over.<p>
