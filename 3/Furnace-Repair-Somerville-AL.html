<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you would not offer them.. Secondly like prolonged vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
