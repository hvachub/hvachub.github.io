<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
