<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer auto debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in monthly, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
