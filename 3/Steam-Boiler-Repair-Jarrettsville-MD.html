<p>Over the past few years, there has been some publicity recommending that houseplants have been revealed to lower levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is currently no evidence, nevertheless, that an affordable variety of houseplants get rid of significant quantities of pollutants in homes and offices. Since extremely wet soil may promote the development of microorganisms which can impact allergic people, indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered.<p>
