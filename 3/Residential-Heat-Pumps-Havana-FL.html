<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
