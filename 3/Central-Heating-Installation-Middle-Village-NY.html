<p>House owners might also assume that due to the fact that a radiant floor heating system can be viewed (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will immediately raise their home's value. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either favorably or adversely affects property values.

Maybe Realtors must consider too many variables to definitively specify what a radiant heating system may add to, or deduct from, any provided asking price. That stated, property buyers seeking to go green," who prioritize energy cost savings, or who definitely desire an in-floor heater will be willing to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
