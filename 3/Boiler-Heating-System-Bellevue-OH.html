Depending upon the type of unit installed, it can be loud and trigger issues if you're highly adverse dust.

EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
