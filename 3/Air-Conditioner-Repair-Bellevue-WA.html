<p>To state there are a great deal of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement.

And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s underneath the box to raise it up and safeguard it from wetness.<p>

<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Bellevue Washington</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the see. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were going out.

I was really happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
