<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
