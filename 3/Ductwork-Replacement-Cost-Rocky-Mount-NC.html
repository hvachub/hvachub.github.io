<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Rocky Mount NC Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Even newer furnaces less than 5 years old have been found as bad. Too many property owners are surprised to discover that their 'brand-new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. Sometimes it is due to poor furnace design, but in many cases, it's from neglect. Apotheosis Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Security Evaluation of your furnace consists of a System Analysis, which checks for debris on the burners, bad airflow, and a filthy filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as required. The Performance Check-Up (see previous answer above) is also essential to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
