<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has been running problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
