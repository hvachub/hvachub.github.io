Today's heating systems are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can mean substantial cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by performing at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is basic. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the flooring level.

All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has actually been operating for a while, including people. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
