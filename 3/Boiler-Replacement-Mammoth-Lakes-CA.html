<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
