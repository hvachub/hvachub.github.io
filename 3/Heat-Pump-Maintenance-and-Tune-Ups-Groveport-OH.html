As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or renovation of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, home appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide gas Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be used with fans that send out exhaust outside. Gas-fired heating home appliances must be sealed and power-vented systems set up to get rid of products of incomplete combustion. Wood-burning ranges can also create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
