<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
