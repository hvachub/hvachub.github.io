The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>We have actually been exceptionally delighted with Integrity's equipment (Trane dealership) and service (today Braxten completed annual maintenance of our system). Trane heatpump has worked effectively and is so effective that it substantially reduced our utility expenditures - the system will pay for itself in less than 5 years.
