<p>For every load of laundry you dry, that moisture has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a efficient and straightforward method to reduce ambient air contamination and potential health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>

Other aspects such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can likewise impact how people react to the indoor environment.<p>
