<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your house that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air pollutants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their job. Not just does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to pricey repairs down the roadway. So, make certain to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which typically includes a filter modification - particularly if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor toxin levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air contaminants out of the area. High temperature and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
