<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.
