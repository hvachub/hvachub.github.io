<p>While pollutant levels from specific sources might not pose a significant health risk by themselves, most houses have more than one source that adds to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious danger from the cumulative impacts of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new problems from taking place. This security guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you decide whether to do something about it that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow greater airflow from the outdoors, air quality tracking platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air filtration technologies are ending up being more common as readily available options in residential and commercial HVAC item packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been extensive, as clients stay mainly unconcerned to the effects of air quality on health and productivity.<p>
