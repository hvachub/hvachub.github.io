<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Convected heat systems have been around considering that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a warm water supply.

<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives generally total up to in between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary rate of a system competitive with standard equipment. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout new construction (homes normally use between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, brand-new installation practices are minimizing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
