<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job finding the outside system as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
