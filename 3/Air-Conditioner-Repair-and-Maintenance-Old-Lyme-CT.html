<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to poor indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from processes or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Normal sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might consist of unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside during water use.<p>
