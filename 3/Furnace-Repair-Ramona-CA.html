<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
