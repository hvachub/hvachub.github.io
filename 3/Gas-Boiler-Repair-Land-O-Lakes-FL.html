"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate great but Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I believe any future organisation related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
