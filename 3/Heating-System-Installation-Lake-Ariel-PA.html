If the valves on the water pipe going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
