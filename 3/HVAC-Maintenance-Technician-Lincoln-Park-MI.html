The decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked.

<p>Though it might be tough to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your home, however there are many other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but lead to other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unpredictable organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Normally the most effective method to improve indoor air quality is to remove private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to decrease the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective approach to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later on in this section.<p>
