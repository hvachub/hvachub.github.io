AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Picture 6).<p>

PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room cooling provides maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air.<p>
