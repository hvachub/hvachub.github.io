<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all major equipment manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the tangible results of a PM is typically hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were avoided. The majority of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system don't simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance.
