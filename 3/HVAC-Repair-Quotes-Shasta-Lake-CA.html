<p>The impacts of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious. They include delays in physical and mental advancement, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Children, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than adults since lead is more quickly taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more conscious the harmful impacts of lead. Kids might have greater exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated items into their mouths.<p>

<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System at Shasta Lake CA</h3>

<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to effectively cool the house on hot days. Considering bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in little quantities is not poisonous, but may become harmful if high concentrations are permitted to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. They may spread out throughout the whole workplace or building by means of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do establish.<p>
