<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended warranties or service agreements on anything however HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
