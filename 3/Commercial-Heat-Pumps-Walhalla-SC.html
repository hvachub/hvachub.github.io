<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the automobile debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There ought to not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and courteous. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
