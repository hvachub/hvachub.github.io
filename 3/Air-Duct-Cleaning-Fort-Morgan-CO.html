<p>There are a few possibilities to discuss short cycling in extremely cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the really low temperatures. Sometimes, the furnace will just run harder to maintain a warm environment for your house when the weather is incredibly cold. There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact among our service technicians if you need clearness on this problem.<p>
<p>When they place a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The first thing you require to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is unclean, you remain in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next step is to defrost your cooling equipment. The easiest way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature level, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct work, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
