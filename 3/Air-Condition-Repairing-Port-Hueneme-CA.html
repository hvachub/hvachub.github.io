<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
