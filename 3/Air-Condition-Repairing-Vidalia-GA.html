<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the growth of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and contamination. Of course, too-dry air can likewise irritate your sinuses and lungs, while too much indoor humidity can add to the development of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 research study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The ideal humidity in a home is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas ranges can trigger levels of contamination that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your home's square footage. They utilize a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs needed to heat the area. The larger the area, the more effective the home heating system needs to be. For already built house heating unit, the contractor will need to remove the old furnace to add the new one. These charges will be included in the installation costs.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
