<p>The predominant health result connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your threat of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
