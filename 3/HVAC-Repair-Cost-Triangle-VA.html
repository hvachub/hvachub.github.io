<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Triangle</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>If you feel like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you might not have a problem as long as your home still heats to the right temperature.

However, if your system does not appear to be working properly, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you ought to hire a specialist to examine and repair the unit.<p>
