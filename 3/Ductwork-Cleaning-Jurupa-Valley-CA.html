For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, resulting in holes and cracks. If that client had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and protects the part.  a really advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
