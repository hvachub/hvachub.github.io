As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
