<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
