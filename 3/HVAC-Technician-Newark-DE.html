<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your Newark DE Home</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
