<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely made the most of. The majority of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the system has been running problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
