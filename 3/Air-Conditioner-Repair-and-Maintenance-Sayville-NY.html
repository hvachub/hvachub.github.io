<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his workers, devices costs, marketing, energies, and other expenditures prior to paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a company was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal.
