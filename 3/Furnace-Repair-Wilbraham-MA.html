<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor-free, radioactive gas. Radon gas goes into homes through dirt floorings, cracks in concrete walls and floorings, flooring drains pipes, and sumps. When radon becomes trapped in buildings and concentrations build up inside your home, exposure to radon becomes an issue.<p>

<p>These men have actually been excellent. At a real estate agent, I often need contractors to give me a viewpoint for what deal with a home may cost. Recently I needed to get in touch with these men two times. They came out rapidly and provided me a no nonsense estimate for the work.

You guys are officially on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>This is my third time using All the time. Ilan always makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is knowledgeable with these devices). I have absolutely nothing but excellent things to say - he has actually taken excellent care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick response - fast resolution.<p>
<p>A/c unit can create a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a generally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. In time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>
