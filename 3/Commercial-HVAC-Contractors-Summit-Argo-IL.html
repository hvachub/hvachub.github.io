<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
