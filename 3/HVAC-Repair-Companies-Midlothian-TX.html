<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally consist of lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead products.

<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold growth.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those processes consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If one or more of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
