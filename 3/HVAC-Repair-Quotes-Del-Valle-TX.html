<p>The compressor can get too hot and shut down if the condenser coils are clogged. You'll experience intermittent periods of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, tidy them once again. Switch off the power. Turn the a/c service and furnace breaker in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and clean the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work totally unless you do this.<p>
<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
