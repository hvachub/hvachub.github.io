<p>An automobile's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes old and filthy.

A coolant flush is basic maintenance for your automobile's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Car Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Generally the most efficient method to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of individual sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions.

Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this area.<p>
