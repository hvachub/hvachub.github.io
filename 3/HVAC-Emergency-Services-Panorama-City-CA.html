<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>

Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a possibility to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The outcome is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
