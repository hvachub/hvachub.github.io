A multi-split system 56 is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and enables cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Ductless heatpump are excellent for additions because they do not require any new ductwork to be set up. Since an unit is installed in each space or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
