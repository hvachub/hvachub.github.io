<p>Specialist heating unit installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC experts recommend following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than needed.<p>
