<h3>What to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Swarthmore PA</h3>
<p>I confess I haven't done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine assessments. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their deal with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
