<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high sufficient temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be warmed without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, supplying warm air to individual bed rooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or registers.<p>
