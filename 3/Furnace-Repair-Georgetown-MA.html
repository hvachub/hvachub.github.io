<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for consultation and assistance in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this item. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
