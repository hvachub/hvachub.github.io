<p>Sean was very handy. He is a very pleasant individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
