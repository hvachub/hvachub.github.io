<p>Expert HVAC service technicians recommend residents of the City of Redmond have access to cooling and heater inside their homes. During the summer and winter seasons, central air units and heating systems provide enough cooling and heating power to homes in Redmond. The average daytime temperature level highs range from the low to upper-70s throughout June, July, and August, and when heat waves pass through the neighborhood, temperature levels will increase to the mid-80s. When properly installed and well kept, central air conditioning units keep homeowners of Redmond cool and comfortable indoors.<p>
<p>A specialized air conditioning system that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a standard a/c in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air path. A basic a/c unit transfers heat energy out of the space due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside. Nevertheless, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>
