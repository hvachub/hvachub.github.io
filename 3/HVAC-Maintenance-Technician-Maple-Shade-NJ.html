<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me concerning an unusually high costs that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue.

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is brought on by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main route of exposure is through the development of an aerosol result, most typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or preserved evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to get infection.<p>
