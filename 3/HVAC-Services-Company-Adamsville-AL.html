<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in big commercial buildings can not be successfully identified or treated without a thorough structure investigation.

Sometimes, these inquiries may rapidly uncover the problem and on-site check outs are unnecessary.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator.

While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
