<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
