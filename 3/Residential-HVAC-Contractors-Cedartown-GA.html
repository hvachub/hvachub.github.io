<h3>Best Central Air Conditioner in Cedartown GA 30125</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that is in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, know that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause costly compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still needed to have a specialist technician check the system periodically.<p>
