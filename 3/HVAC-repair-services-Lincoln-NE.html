<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
