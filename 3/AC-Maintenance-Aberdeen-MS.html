<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Well-maintained heating equipment can last for years.

<p>Heat Exchanger Replacement: â $ " Â The heat exchanger is at the very core of the furnace. Replacing one implies disassembling most of the furnace, replacing the part, and reassembling the furnace. The variety of hours it takes frequently triggers the repair to be costlier than the furnace was or a brand-new one would be. If you replace a furnace due to a bad heat exchanger, consider anÂ Amana, Goodman or Daikin due to the fact that they have the best heat exchanger service warranties in the industry on their leading heating systems.<p>
