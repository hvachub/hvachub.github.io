<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Vital Business in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year back and they have actually been to your house for a system tune-up 3 times now.

<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which anticipates air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that enables the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system parts, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They advised changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a fast web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Damaging direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is incorrectly eliminated from surface areas by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from outdoor sources, consisting of polluted soil tracked within, and usage of lead in particular indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
