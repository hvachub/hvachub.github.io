Capacity for geothermal systems is determined in tons.

<h3>Geothermal Heating And Cooling in Commack New York</h3>
<p>Reality: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely uncommon now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
