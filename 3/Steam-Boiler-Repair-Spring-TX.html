<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roof, is most commonly used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units include not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, because the unit is integrated. However, one con is that these units are typically only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
