Extra weatherization procedures ought to not be undertaken until these issues have been remedied.<p>

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
