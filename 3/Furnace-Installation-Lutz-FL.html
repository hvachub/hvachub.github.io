<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>Prior to you go out and purchase an air conditioner, there are a few things to decide first. Where are you going to be installing the ac system?

Too big and you'll encounter problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning unit and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c won't be able to cool your house properly. When shopping for a brand-new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you require to take into account. Each choice can and will significantly impact your system's efficiency, which is why you can't manage to overlook any of them.<p>
