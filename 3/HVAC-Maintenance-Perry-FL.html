Loose, faulty or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service.

Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always utilized in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
