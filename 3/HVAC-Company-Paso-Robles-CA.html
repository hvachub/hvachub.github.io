Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Image 2). The minimized airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
