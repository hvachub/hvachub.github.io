<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical flexible hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
