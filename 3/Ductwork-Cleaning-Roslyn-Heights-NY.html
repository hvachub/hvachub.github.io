<h3>HVAC Filters in Roslyn Heights NY 11577</h3>
<p>I have been utilizing them for years for my companies, my own homes and my real estate clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various prices and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC stopped working at my rental home. He assisted me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again. He is sincere, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's hard to discover an honest AC person and I'm happy I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
