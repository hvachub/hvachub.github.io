<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, because some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling separately for each space. However, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units run individually from each other.<p>
