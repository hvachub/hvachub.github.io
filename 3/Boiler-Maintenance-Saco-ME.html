<p>Excellent Item! Shipment was sort of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we assured it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and takes some time to apply. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would recommend this item to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the very first time.

<p>A specialized air conditioner that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but differs from a basic a/c unit in that both the evaporator and the condenser are positioned in the same air course. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a basic air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, because all parts of the dehumidifier are in the same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is in fact warmed, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the same amount of power.<p>

<p>I am changing our High Speed System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat.

<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for ac system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
