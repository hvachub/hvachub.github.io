<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. It's an obscure fact that the quality and cleanliness of your air ductwork is just as important as your HVAC system. Dust and gunk will often develop in ductwork, limiting airflow.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a few years back.<p>
