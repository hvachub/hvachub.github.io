<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus needs conditions suitable for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Remediation for Legionella break outs in commercial structures vary, but frequently include extremely hot water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and sometimes flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive measures consist of changing normal hot water levels to allow for 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating center design layout, getting rid of faucet aerators, and routine testing in suspect locations.<p>
