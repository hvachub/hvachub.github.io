(If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
