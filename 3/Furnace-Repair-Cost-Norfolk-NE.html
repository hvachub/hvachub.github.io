<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside your home. Most house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of contaminants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
