The best central air conditioner you can purchase today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while delivering the same quantity of cooling.<p>

<h3>Ways To Get the Most out of Your HVAC System in Vienna VA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels really increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

<p>Ron, the owner, connected to me relating to an unusually high bill that I got blindsided by BEFORE he knew that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of issue.
