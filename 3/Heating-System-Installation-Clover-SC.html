<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was essential and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the specialists thought they just didn't appear ideal and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
