<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The possibility of instant responses to indoor air pollutants depends upon several aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. Sometimes, whether an individual responds to a pollutant depends upon private sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical contaminants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>
<p>The results of lead exposure on fetuses and kids can be extreme. They include delays in mental and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral issues. Fetuses, babies, and children are more susceptible to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead. Kids might have higher exposures considering that they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
