<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Function in Wamego KS?</h3>
<p>For whole house setups, it's tough, if almost difficult, to retrofit a convected heat system in an existing house, especially a hydronic system. Localized radiant floor heat systems to be used in one or a number of rooms like restrooms, cooking areas or laundry rooms are quickly refurbished with electric radiant flooring heat. This is far more cost-effective on a smaller sized scale. Bigger renovations like additions to a house may appropriate for a larger scale and more expensive hydronic system.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
