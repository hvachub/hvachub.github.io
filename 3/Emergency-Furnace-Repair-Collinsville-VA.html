There can be a severe danger from the cumulative effects of these sources. Thankfully, there are steps that many people can take both to reduce the danger from existing sources and to avoid brand-new issues from taking place. This safety guide was prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Item Security Commission (CPSC) to help you choose whether to act that can decrease the level of indoor air contamination in your own house.<p>
