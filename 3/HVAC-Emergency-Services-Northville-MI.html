<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
