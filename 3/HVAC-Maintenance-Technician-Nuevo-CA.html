<p>I usually don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not prepare for having to replace your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
