High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can take full advantage of efficiency and provide longer enduring house heating. However, there are times when a basic maintenance call can determine a problem that will require a substantial financial investment to correct. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the pricey repair and enjoy continued comfort from your present heater? Or, do you make an even bigger monetary dedication to replacing the furnace? The decision to repair or replace is up to you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the devices, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely provides higher energy performance and features warranty coverage.<p>
