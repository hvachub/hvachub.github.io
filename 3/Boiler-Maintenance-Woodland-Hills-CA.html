<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts decades, since it is secured indoors. When it does require to be changed, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards remove the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Recent Review: They were fantastic! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested.
