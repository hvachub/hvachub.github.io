<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
