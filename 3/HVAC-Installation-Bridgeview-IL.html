<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more cash on cooling expenses in the long run since of the lower energy performance.<p>
