Since its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is removed. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is in fact heated, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
