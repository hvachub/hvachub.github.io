<p>We required two visits - Jake came out first and was very well-informed and pleasant and respectful. Grant came out a couple days later and was nice and also knowledgeable to talk to. They both did a fantastic task. Sabre's workplace personnel is really practical, calling prior to the arrival of the technician, and offering the technician's name and approximate arrival time. They are also well priced for their services. Definitely recommend.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A great place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it!
