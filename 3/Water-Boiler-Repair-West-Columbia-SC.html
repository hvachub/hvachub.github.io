<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage.

The effects of CO direct exposure can differ significantly from person to person depending upon age, total health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
