<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you choose them up, do decline them until they have actually been correctly dried. If items with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent check outs, try a various dry cleaner.<p>
