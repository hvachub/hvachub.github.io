<h3>Commercial Air Conditioning Installation in Lebanon NH 03766</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
