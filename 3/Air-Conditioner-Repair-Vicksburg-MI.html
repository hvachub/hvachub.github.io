Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank. If the heat exchanger is external to the storage tank, it is likely that it is supported by the pipes. If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have actually to be cut.<p>
