<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
