<p>The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends upon numerous factors. Age and preexisting medical conditions are two crucial influences. In other cases, whether an individual reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which differs significantly from person to individual. Some individuals can end up being sensitized to biological contaminants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical toxins also.<p>
<p>Usually the most reliable way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of pollution or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is also a more affordable approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation due to the fact that increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later on in this section.<p>
<p>The primary health impact associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
