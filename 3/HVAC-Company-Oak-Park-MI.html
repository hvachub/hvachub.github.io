<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental risk to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which humans are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, degrading paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, fuel, water pipes, and many other products.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to prevent further damage to your system.<p>

If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
