<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your home. Heat pumps run on electricity and work like air conditioning system in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating system (like an area heating system) with the exact same quantity of electrical energy. They can be linked to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
