<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the system has been operating problem totally free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
