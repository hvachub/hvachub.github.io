<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take an image of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
