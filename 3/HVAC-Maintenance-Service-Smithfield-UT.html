<h3>Factors to Consider When Looking for a Fantastic AC Repair Company at Smithfield UT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his assessment, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a referral later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
