<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Hastings MN</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that someone as skilled as Adam had the ability to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the a/c unit prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had methods to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>

Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
