<h3>Furnace Maintenance in Macomb Michigan</h3>
<p>New air conditioners typically vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A greater SEER score implies higher energy efficiency and potentially lower energy expenses. A good SEER score for you depends on your home size, where you live and other factors. Even the minimally enabled SEER ranking is going to be much more energy effective than your current, old a/c. It's not always about picking the design with the greatest SEER ranking, it's discovering the one that's right for you. This is where your dealer can assist.<p>
<p>Geothermal air conditioning is a smart and cost-efficient  way to cool down your home or place of business when the temperatures keep climbing. But when your AC system stops working efficiently or starts to breakdown, you need an educated contractor to come in and get it fixed as quickly as possible. Which's where we can help. At All The Time Air Conditioning & Heating, Inc. in Rye Brook, NY, we supply geothermal cooling repair services to commercial and residential consumers alike.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. In addition, a fresh, clean filter better traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star recommends replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, check the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
