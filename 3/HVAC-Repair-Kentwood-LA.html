<p>We tend to think about air pollution as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer. These convection heaters are still widely used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown.

The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is usually oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone building systems.
