This action is vital so the system isn't too small or too large-both waste energy.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
