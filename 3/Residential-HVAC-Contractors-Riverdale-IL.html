This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to develop the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC entrepreneur must pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their earnings while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
