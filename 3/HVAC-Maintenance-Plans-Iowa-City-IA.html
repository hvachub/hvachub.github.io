<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here).

So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
