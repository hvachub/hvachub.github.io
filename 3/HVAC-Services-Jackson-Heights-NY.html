That's why routinely evaluating and upgrading your service strategy is so essential.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
