HVAC professionals advise following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new.

<p>For example, impurities might collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing contaminants into the environment.
