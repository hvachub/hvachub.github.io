<h3>Truth About Clarksville TN Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was extremely clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a picture of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Photo 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
