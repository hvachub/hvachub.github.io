Also, real estate prices in Seattle have skyrocketed, and as an outcome, newer homes are getting taller and skinnier, with bedrooms on the upper levels. Numerous attics are also being converted to end up bed rooms to include extra area. Spaces in the upper areas of houses are specifically prone to getting uncomfortable and incredibly hot during the summer, making a/c a lot more essential.<p>
<p>If the AC does not shut off, it might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't release heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay may have welded together-- something that can occur with time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to inspecting the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick till you buy a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
