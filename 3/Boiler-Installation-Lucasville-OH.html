The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the space controllable. The regulated temperature level and humidity helped preserve constant paper dimensions and ink positioning. Later on, Provider's innovation was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and The Provider A/c Company of America was formed to fulfill increasing need. With time, cooling came to be used to improve comfort in homes and vehicles also.<p>
