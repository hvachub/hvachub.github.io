<p>Called WSE for a regular inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the check out. They advised replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a quick web search verified WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the see or the new part.

<p>If the condenser coils are blocked, the compressor can shut and overheat down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling.

Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2).
