Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per heap, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap.

<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and efficiently, however to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Another method to decreasing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
