<p>These people have actually been terrific. At a realtor, I often require contractors to offer me a viewpoint for what work on a home may cost. Just recently I needed to contact these guys twice.

<p>You could upgrade to the greatest performance equipment available and still not feel conveniently cool on hot days. That's because the mechanicals are only part of the central air conditioning system. The average house's ductwork leaks 10% to 30% of its air before it can reach your living space, according to Pacific Gas & Electric. Before deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air gets away the system.<p>
