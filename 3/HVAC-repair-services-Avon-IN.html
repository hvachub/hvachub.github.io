<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to choose initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning system be? Too big and you'll face issues with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioner and reduce its life. Too small and your a/c will not have the ability to cool your house properly.

<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must watch out for. First, you should inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
