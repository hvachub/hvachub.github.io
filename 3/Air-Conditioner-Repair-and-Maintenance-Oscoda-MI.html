<h3>Factors to Consider When Searching for a Good AC Repair Company at Oscoda MI</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, but I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to regular examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely quickly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
