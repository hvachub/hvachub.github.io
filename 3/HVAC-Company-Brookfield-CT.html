<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating systems are still commonly used and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A regular furnace tune up can maximize performance and offer longer enduring home heating. However, there are times when an easy maintenance call can recognize a problem that will need a significant financial investment to correct. Then, it's choice time.

The choice to repair or change depends on you, and typically it refers comparing the cost to repair, taking into consideration the age of the devices, versus the cost of a brand-new furnace that likely uses higher energy efficiency and includes warranty coverage.<p>
