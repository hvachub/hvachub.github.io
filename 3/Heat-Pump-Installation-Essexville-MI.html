Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
