In other cases, such changes subtly and even considerably change structures in manner ins which may be important to their own integrity or their impact on building residents through the evolution of the physical, chemical, and biological procedures that specify them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, especially, some of the methods used by researchers studying environments, in order to get a boosted understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our structures.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy.
