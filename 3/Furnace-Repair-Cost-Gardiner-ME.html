Though specific policies have not been developed for IAQ in the work place, the Environment, Health and Safety Department (EHS) considers suggestions from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and A/c Engineers (ASHRAE).<p>

<p>Air conditioning and refrigeration are supplied through the removal of heat. Heat can be removed through radiation, convection, or conduction The heat transfer medium is a refrigeration system, such as water, air, ice, and chemicals are described as refrigerants A refrigerant is utilized either in a heat pump system in which a compressor is utilized to drive thermodynamic refrigeration cycle, or in a free cooling system which uses pumps to distribute a cool refrigerant (normally water or a glycol mix).<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed just a couple of years earlier.<p>
<p>There are several non-profit organizations that accredit indoor air quality specialists.
