<p>Cooling can also be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
