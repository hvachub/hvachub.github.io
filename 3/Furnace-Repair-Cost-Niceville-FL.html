A qualified technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
