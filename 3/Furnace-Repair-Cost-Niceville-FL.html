<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your air conditioner is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leakages. A qualified technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the maker's specification, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
