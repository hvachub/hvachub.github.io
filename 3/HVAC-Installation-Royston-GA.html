Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money coming in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement..
