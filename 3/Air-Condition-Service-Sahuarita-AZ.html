<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
