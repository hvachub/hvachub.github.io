<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to correctly harden and cure-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>In some cases a momentary indoor air quality problem is developed just by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded conference location.

However more complex problems-- recognized by consistently undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending upon the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 methods below might be appropriate.<p>
