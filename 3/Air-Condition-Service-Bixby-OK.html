<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price great however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
