Even if you make sure" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Turn off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work effectively after you've cleaned the condenser coils, set up a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work fully unless you do this.<p>
