<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace at Penn Valley CA?</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
