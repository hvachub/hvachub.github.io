<p>I'll begin with a gas furnace because it's the most common heating system in Seattle houses. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is collected via cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for effectiveness. Older units from the 1970s may be ranked 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a brand-new, efficient gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated procedure. Installing a brand-new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
