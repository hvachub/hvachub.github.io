(If the thermostat you purchase is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem breaker trips.
