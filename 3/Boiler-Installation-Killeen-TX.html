<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their total power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor system. Simply put, the outside system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the spaces might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, since it takes into account not just the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
