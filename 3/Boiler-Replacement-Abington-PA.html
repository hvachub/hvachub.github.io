In some circumstances, other tradespeople will deal with HVAC techs to help set up or repair cooling and heating unit. For instance, on a large a/c installation job, especially one in which employees are covered by union agreements, ductwork may be done by sheet metal workers and duct installers, or electrical work by electricians Repairs to family fridges or window air conditioning system are often performed by house device repair services versus HVAC specialists.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear quickly after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures to a pollutant. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are treatable and generally short-term. Often the treatment is just eliminating the individual's direct exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Right after exposure to some indoor air pollutants, symptoms of some illness such as asthma might appear, be intensified or gotten worse.<p>
<p>It is not recommended that "regular" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to determine if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a certain standard. Occupational direct exposure limitations listed in health and wellness guidelines and the Threshold Limit Worths ® (TLVs) recommended by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid disease or specific effects (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial situations. These limits may not be suitable in office settings or for the home.<p>
