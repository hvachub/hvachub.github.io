<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Next, and maybe simply as important when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>

Any interference or interruption in the flow of electrical energy makes the system inoperable. This is among the downsides to setting up an electric radiant heat system. However, assuming they are installed properly and correctly taken care of, the likelihood of them having problems is small.<p>
