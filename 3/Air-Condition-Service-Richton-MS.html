<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Richton MS</h3>
<p>Throughout winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  service through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, sending the absorbed heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression procedure. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heating system.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy since an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also needed to routinely clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
