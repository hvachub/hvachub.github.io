<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run. Because it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully.
