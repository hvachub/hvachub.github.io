<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outside measurements used for estimations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be necessary.<p>
