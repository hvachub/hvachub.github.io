<p>As much of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices manufacturer's to ensure your factory warranties remain in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is frequently hard to measure, as one action mentioned the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. Most pieces of a furnace or ac system do not simply break at the snap of a finger, but instead is the outcome of recurring usage of an element that is out of balance.
