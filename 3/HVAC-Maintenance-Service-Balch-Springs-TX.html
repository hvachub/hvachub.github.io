<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
