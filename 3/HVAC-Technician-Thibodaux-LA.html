A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair today.<p>
