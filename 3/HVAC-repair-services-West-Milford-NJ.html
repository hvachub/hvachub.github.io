<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in terms of environmental costs. Due to the fact that the energy used to heat your house is drawn out straight from the ground, it secures the environment from damaging digging, fracking, or toxins.

While geothermal systems do utilize some electrical power, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other contaminants than heating systems that require gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
