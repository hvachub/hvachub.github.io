<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>
