<p>Trace was the service technician that took care of my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, polite, and respected my house by always wearing boot coverings when entering my home. He demonstrated the points of examination and also recommended I have a UV light set up due to a small buildup of mold collecting in the air handler, which he completely examined and cleaned up the exterior compressor coils in addition to ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a store vacuum. He likewise got rid of the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor unit and suggested a solution to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed email report of the evaluation detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

<p>Re-install the access panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Client at Start-up," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan must spin. If the compressor starts but the fan does not, the fan motor is most likely shot. Shut off the power and remove the screws around the condenser cover. Raise the cover and remove the fan blade and motor (Photo 7). Re-install the blade and protect the cover. Then repower the unit and see if the fan begins. If  it doesn't, you've given it your best shot-- it's time to call a pro.<p>
