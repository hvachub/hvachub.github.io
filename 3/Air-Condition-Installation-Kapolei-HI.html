<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil.
