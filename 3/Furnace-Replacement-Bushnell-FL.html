<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
