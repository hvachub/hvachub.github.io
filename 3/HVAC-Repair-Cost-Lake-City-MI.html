<h3>The Smart Homeowner's Checklist for All Things HVAC Repairin Lake City MI</h3>
<p>I confess I have not done the math recently, however I have actually had a service contract on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's paid for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
