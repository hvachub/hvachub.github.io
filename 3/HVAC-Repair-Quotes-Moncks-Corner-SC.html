As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. However, since all components of the dehumidifier remain in the exact same space, no heat is eliminated.

<h3>Heating Tips For Gas Home Furnaces at Moncks Corner SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Because an a/c unit moves heat between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both must be kept clean. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to frequently clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will eventually lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
