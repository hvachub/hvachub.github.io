<p>All houses require efficient ventilation.

Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) has actually been tied to symptoms like headaches, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and inflammation of the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. Also, some particular diseases have actually been connected to particular air impurities or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not trigger immediate signs however can cause cancer after many years.<p>

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Outdoor contaminants. When the heating or cooling system draws air into a house, outdoor particulates can be drawn inside. Particulates and allergens found in outside air can be asthma triggers.
