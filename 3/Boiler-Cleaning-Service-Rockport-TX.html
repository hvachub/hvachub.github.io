<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summertime a/c. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
