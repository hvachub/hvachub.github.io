<p>Ensure there are no carpets, furnishings, or anything else limiting the circulation of air. Not only will blocked vents and registers affect your comfort, they can also lead to duct leaks due to excessive air pressure and premature HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused rooms is NOT a good idea. You won't save any additional money and will end up triggering more problems for your heating unit.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and accreditations. A good location to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation understand that the home is a system and see HVAC devices as simply one element (out of many) of a comfortable environment.<p>
