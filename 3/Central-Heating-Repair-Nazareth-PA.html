<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor.

In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll discover the motor running hotter. Prior to that takes place, you want to get those capacitors changed to prevent more damage to your system.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it comes to central air expenses, is the AC unit's size.

On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger units cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air conditioning system requires to hold.<p>
