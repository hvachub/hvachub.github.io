<p>One of the drawbacks of central heating is that it's potentially costly to install, especially in an older home. Depending on the type of system set up, it can be loud and cause issues if you're highly adverse dust. Furthermore, particular fuels and equipment might require special licenses, and there is restricted versatility in the event of altered heating requirements. Throughout use, there is a time delay while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large commercial and office complex such as skyscrapers and medical facilities, automobiles such as vehicles, trains, planes, submarines and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with respect to temperature level and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>

Purchased a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended warranties or service arrangements on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
