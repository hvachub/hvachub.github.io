<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Stability Energy was quick to respond when I called Gregg at 9:00 pm when our 2 heaters were not working. They appeared the next day and replaced two heating systems and make them work. Bryson and Rob worked from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm on Friday until the brand-new heating systems can heat the house. Truthfully, our house heating unit is made complex, Rob and his group repaired the old duct, altered all the dampers, make the whole system work completely.<p>
