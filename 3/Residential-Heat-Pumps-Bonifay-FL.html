You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs between $300 to $500 usually.

At the very same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
