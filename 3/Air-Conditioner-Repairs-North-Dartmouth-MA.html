<h3>Facts That You Might Not Know About a Boiler Heating System in North Dartmouth MA</h3>
<p>Among the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is blocked or unclean Before attempting to repair any issue, take time to make sure that the thermostat settings are not at constant fan". Inspect the furnace blower for obstructing and clean it if the air filter is excellent to go. Have a look at the furnace blower motor and lubricate it if this does not work. Call a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
