<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, especially in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly used and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace across which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the advancement and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which forecasts air flows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in big residential, workplace, and school structures.<p>
