<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the rate great but Mark headed out of his way to customize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
