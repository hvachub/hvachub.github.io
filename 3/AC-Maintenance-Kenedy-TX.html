Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>Heatpump are a dream come to life for folks in Seattle. A/c is something that the majority of Seattleites will only use sparingly, however because heatpump can provide both heating and cooling through a single system of ductwork, you'll have the very best of both worlds!
