<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Rockland MA</h3>
<p>All modern-day cooling systems, even little window bundle units, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry family pets, will need to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
