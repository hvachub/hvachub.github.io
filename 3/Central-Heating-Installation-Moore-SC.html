<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There ought to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Chemical pollutants: Volatile natural substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are numerous, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally taking place chemical substances. Chemical toxins can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, furniture and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and people with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
