I went through five other companies prior to I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ may see moldy or unpleasant odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. But not all exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>

The ventilation, air and heating conditioning business tends to run cold and hot. When customers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather gets here, demand warms up during the summer and winter season.<p>
