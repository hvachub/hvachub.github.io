<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating unit, consisting of electric heating units and boilers.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<h3>Portable Air Conditioner in Moody AL 35004</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta give whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
