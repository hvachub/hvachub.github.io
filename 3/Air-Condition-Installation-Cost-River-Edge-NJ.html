<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My oldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy saving too.<p>
