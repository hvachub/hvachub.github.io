With time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To deal with condensate issues, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>
