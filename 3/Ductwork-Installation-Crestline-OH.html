<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
