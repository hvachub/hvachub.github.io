<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up evaluation results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
