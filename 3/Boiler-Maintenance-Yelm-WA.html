<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO preserve the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, choose your contractor carefully, many of the 'reputable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO make the most of uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
