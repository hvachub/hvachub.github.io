<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant devices producer's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in location. Furthermore, the tangible outcomes of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one response stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or ac system don't just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive use of an element that is out of balance. For example, a heat exchanger may fail too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and causing early wear and tear, causing cracks and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure remains in line and protects the element.  a very useful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly conserved a client thousands.<p>
