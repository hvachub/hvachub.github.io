PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each space to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space air conditioning provides maximum versatility, when utilized to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air.<p>
