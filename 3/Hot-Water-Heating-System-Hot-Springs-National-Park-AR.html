<p>In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products made using adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood items made for indoor use consist of: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (used for ornamental wall covering and used in cabinets and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board consists of a higher resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is generally recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood item.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
