<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heating units are still extensively utilized and are normally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the advancement and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality designs, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and contaminant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based on a graphic user interface that allows the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent air flow courses, ventilation system elements, and impurity sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
