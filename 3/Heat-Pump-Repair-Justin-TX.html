<p>Information provided in this safety guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders developed by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. Structures continuously evolve as a result of the changes in the environment around them along with the occupants, products, and activities within them. The various surfaces and the air inside a building are continuously communicating, and this interaction results in modifications in each. For instance, we might see a window as changing somewhat in time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt again, is cleaned once again, and so on through its life.

Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing costs, to the point where the rate is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
