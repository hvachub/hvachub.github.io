<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power should not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, because the total capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a really comfy temperature level. However, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, since it considers not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone airflow and indoor air quality models, particularly the CONTAM series which predicts air flows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in big residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
