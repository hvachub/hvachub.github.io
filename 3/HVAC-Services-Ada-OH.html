<p>To set up a safe consultation or appointment with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing professionals in your location in an online search.

<p>There is no simple response, however many utilize the guideline that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is most likely a much better option.
