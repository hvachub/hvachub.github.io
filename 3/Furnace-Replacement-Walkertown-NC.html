<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Walkertown NC</h3>
<p>If you need furnace operate in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to order it. My partner stated that she had seen a fantastic review for James, so I called. He came in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have satisfied in a very long time.
