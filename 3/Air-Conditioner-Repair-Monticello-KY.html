I have 2 heaters - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just insane and all over the place and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
