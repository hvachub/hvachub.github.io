<p>Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and location of pollutant direct exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor stripping and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Area control includes moving the pollutant source away from residents or perhaps relocating prone residents.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high effectiveness, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>Additionally, homeowners have a range of alternatives to pick from in powering a flooring heating unit. Radiant systems work with electrical, gas, even geothermal and solar energy sources.
