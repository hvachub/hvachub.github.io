<p>Check these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked.

Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
