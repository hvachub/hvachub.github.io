Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce contaminants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>The primary health result connected with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your risk of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
