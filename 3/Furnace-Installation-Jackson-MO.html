<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are classified as a Vital Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective.

The size of geothermal heatpump and the size of ground loop needed depends upon the cooling and heating requirements for your house and is vital iin ensuring the performance and performance of the system. Capability for geothermal systems is measured in lots. Normally, a 3-ton setup should be enough for the average home, but home size, heating and cooling needs, local geology and soil, and land availability are all factors which will influence the appropriate size for your specific house. Energy Environmental Corporation is experienced in geothermal heatpump installation and can help you appropriately size a system.<p>
