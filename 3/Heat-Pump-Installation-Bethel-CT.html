<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically described as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also switches roles to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
