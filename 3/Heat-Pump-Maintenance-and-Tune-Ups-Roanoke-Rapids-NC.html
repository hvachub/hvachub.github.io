<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to minimize the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, actions must likewise be taken to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for recommended actions.)
