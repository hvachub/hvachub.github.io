<p>Not all sensors work the exact same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes. If you're working with an Internet of Things company like Iota, your indoor air quality tracking equipment will send out the sensing unit data to the cloud, where you can access it through software. You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results by means of a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are easy to understand.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested. They satisfied my requirements entirely by offering an expert quote with options, without pressing extra products. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely recommend this company.<p>
