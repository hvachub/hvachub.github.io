<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
