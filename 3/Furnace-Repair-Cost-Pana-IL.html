<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>All modern a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are generally of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions call for. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters altered more often than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. In addition, extremely filthy or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>

Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding.
