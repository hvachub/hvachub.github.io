<p>Geothermal heat pumps are exceptionally effective, since ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature level is constantly at a constant temperature level. These systems can achieve a geothermal efficiency of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter season nights; whereas air-source heatpump can only obtain an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter. Much like other types of heat pumps, ground source heat pumps have their geothermal efficiency rated according to their coefficient of efficiency (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or gets rid of (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus how much the system utilizes to produce the heating or cooling result.

<p>Check these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2).

Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
