<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Second of all like extended auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and also the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the unit has actually been operating issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
