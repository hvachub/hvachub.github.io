<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually triggered by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in majority the work environment indoor air investigations it has conducted. Investigations performed in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be real. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is necessary in maintaining excellent indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Many well and city water does not typically include lead. Water usually picks up lead inside the house from family pipes that is made with lead products. The only method to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water provider to find out how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water.

<p>Individuals working in structures with poor IAQ might notice moldy or undesirable odors or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>

Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
