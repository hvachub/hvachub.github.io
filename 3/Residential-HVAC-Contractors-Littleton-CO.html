Initially, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
