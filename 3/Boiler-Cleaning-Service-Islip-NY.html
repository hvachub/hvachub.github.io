<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act just like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. If your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most cost effective. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that enable greater air flow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensors, and new air purification technologies are ending up being more common as available solutions in commercial and residential HVAC item bundles. Adoption of these innovations, however, has actually not been widespread, as clients remain mostly unconcerned to the results of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Likewise, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For instance, humans breathe out co2, which in small amounts is not hazardous, but might end up being hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to accumulate. Germs or micro-organisms may likewise exist within the ventilation system. They may spread throughout the whole work environment or building by methods of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
