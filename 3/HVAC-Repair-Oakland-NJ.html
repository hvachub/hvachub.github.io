<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
