<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. Connection concerns along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the performance of the unit. Loose, missing or faulty wires will cause the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service.
