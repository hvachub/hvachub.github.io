<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the price fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Free cooling systems can have really high effectiveness, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>As a lot of you discussed, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment maker's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. Moreover, the tangible outcomes of a PM is frequently difficult to quantify, as one action stated the cost savings in performance or repairs that were prevented. The majority of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repetitive usage of an element that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might fail prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.  a really helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, however one that possibly conserved a customer thousands.<p>
