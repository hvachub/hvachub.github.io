<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the rate fantastic however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced.

<h3>Working of a HVAC System in North Haven CT</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably the same physical product in time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
