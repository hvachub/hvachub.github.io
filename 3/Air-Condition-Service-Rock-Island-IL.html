<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to properly treat and harden-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
