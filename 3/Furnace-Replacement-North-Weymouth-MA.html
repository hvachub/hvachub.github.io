Luis was the 6th person, who discussed to me completely the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working again, he helped me trouble shoot the problem. He is honest, trustworthy, and reasonable on rate. It's hard to discover an honest AC guy and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
