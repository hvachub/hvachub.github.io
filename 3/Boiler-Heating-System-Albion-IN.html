Long time Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house.
