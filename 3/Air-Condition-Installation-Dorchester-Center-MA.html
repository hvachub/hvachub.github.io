Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>
