<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
