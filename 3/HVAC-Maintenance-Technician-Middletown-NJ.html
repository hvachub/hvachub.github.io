<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
