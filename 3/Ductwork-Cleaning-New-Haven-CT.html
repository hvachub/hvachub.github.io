Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
