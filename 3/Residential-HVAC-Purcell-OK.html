<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to control than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity needs to be kept at or listed below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for home residents. Unlike other types of a/c unit, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be directed through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be enabled to push the warmer air within your home out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window. 36 These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to keep and understand.<p>
