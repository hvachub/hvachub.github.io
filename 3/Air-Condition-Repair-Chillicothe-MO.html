<h3>HVAC Repair Warnings You Should Not Ignore Chillicothe MO</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were very pleased that someone as knowledgeable as Adam was able to repair the air and return conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the air conditioning unit before you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding noises. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems might be belt-driven. When the belt that connects the motor to the blower slips, squealing noises from a belt-drive air handler typically happen.
