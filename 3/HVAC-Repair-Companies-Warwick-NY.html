<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your home. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
