<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is often called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that features fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
