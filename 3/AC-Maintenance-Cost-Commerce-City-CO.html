These are usually of a light-weight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Furthermore, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>

A voided service warranty will not do you any great must the system stop working or breakdown. Do it right from the start and work with a licensed individual with the experience to install the system.<p>
