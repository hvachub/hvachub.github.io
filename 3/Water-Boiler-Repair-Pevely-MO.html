<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones, the main issue. While setting up a different split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more troubles, since some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a large choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate independently from each other.<p>
