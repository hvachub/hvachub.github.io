<p>Air-conditioning systems are always working to give your home that best temperature level all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can result in expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to change your AC filters routinely, or get an a/c service plan which generally includes a filter modification - specifically if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you ought to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
