Next, switch off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2).

When the heatpump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser unit also changes functions to work as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (cooler than the ambient outside air).<p>
