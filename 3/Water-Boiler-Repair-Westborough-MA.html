<p>Sean was really valuable. He is an extremely pleasant person to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work.

No extra charge.<p>
