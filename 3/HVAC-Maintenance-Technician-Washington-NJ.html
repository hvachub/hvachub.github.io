The selection of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside system.

Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not basic, because it takes into account not just the nominal power of the systems, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
