Nevertheless, select your contractor carefully, many of the 'credible' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable rating are the exact same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me concern and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
