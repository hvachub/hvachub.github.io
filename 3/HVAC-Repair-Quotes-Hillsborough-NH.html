Initially, you must inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
