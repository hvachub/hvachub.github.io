The product was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center..
