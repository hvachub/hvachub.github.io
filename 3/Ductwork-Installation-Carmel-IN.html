<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 various hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system.

We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
