For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it indicates the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove moisture. The goal is to provide enough changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
