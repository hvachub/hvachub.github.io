<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, considering that the overall capability of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor system. Basically, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not easy, considering that it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system warms by distributing hot water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
