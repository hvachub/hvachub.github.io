<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a reference later on). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
