<p>A packaged unit, usually set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial structures, but it is likewise an alternative for property owners to think about. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this system is surely the cost. Packaged systems are terrific for those seeking to conserve cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system individually, given that the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the very best option for homeowners searching for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
