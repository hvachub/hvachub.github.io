<p>At present, EPA does not suggest using air cleaners to lower levels of radon and its decay products.

<p>Iâ $ m really choosy with my stuff. I like my equipment and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So purchasing this a/c unit to change my old one was rather of a tough reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Am glad I got this however since it has actually restored my faith in great production. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this brand-new Carrier I got considering that I bought it 7 months ago. Itâ $ s simply ideal.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years earlier and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
