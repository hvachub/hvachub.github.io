An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear.

During high use months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>

The average daytime temperature level highs during December, January, and February range from the mid-40s to low-50s. Temperature levels will drop below freezing at night, and heavy precipitation is common during the winter months.

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
