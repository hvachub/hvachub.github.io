<p>SysTech Style focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your home. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils makes sure dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>

However, given that all parts of the dehumidifier are in the very same space, no heat energy is eliminated. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually warmed, just as by an electric heater that draws the exact same quantity of power.<p>
