This clause, common to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, states that an employer should provide a healthy and safe work environment. Therefore, making certain the air is of great quality is the company's responsibility.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll conserve money over the long term because of the lower energy expenses. Likewise, a geothermal system tends to last about twice as long as traditional air-source units. The lack of moving parts indicates you're less likely to invest huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
