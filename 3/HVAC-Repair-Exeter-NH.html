<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else might come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they needed to buy it. My other half said that she had actually seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He was available in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and discussed the situation to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it very rapidly. But here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
