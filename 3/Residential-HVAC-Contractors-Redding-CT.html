Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air issues by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
