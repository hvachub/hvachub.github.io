<p>We look at ideas before we supply recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are greater year after year, we know the unit is not running effectively. It might be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to change it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality display can be set up to provide threshold notifies. If, for instance, the outdoors air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you might set up your tracking equipment to notify you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to solve the scenario instantly.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is frequently essential to determining the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such details can in some cases be acquired by asking for copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative must ask for that the company have air monitoring tests conducted. Review of this data might identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health signs. Nevertheless, when impurity concentrations are very low, keeping an eye on data might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
