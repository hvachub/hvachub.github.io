<p>Due to the fact that it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your house via ducts, and cool air is gathered via cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. If you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting, setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite pricey.<p>
