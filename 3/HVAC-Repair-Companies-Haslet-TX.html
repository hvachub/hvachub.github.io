<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe getting in and the pipes leaving the conventional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

<p>Specific immediate results are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically challenging to determine if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the time and location the symptoms happen. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to recognize indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some impacts may be intensified by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions widespread in the home.<p>

<p>It may feel cozy being sealed in tight against the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for individuals who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have breathing issues, winter season can intensify issues. Stale indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, pet dander, and mold spores flowing through your house. In late winter and early spring, it may still be too chilly to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather it's important to be aware of some of the allergy and respiratory triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there are in a room or building, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative influence on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
