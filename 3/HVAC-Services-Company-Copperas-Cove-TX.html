<p>Lead has actually long been acknowledged as a hazardous environmental pollutant. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental danger to the health of children in the United States." There are lots of methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, weakening paint, and dust. When an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead enters the body. Before it was known how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, gas, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>
