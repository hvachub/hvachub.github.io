<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. However, a lot of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic user interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and use "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system components, and pollutant sources. CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in large residential, office, and school buildings.<p>
