<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
