<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just eight to 10 years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's since it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
